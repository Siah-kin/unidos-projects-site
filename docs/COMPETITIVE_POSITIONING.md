## Grant Application Extracts: Why Fund Unidos?

### 1. Track Record (Tier 1 Programs)

**Vermicompost Initiative (Regesoil)**
- **Partnership:** UNHCR Refugee Innovation Fund (completed project)
- **Scale:** 501 farmers trained (350 women, 151 men) March-December 2024
- **Impact:** 7.8 tons/year vermicompost from 800 kg weekly waste
- **Outcomes:** 270 farmers report up to 45% yield increases
- **Infrastructure:** 4 food forest demonstration sites operational

**Mushroom Spawn Multiplication Lab**
- **Unique Asset:** Only lab in Nakivale refugee settlement
- **Production:** 4,800 kg mushrooms harvested (2024)
- **Waste Solution:** 5,000 kg agricultural waste recycled monthly
- **Women-Led:** 152 women trained across 4 groups
- **Income Evidence:** Furaha Bahati (Eagles Power) pays school fees from mushroom sales
- **Health Impact:** Rosetta Nzonga's baby recovered from malnutrition in 2 months
- **Partners:** Re-Alliance, Mycorama

### 2. Innovation (What Others Don't Have)

**Integrated Circular Model:**
- Food waste → Vermicompost → Biochar → Mushroom substrate → Income → Health education
- **No other Nakivale organization** operates this flywheel

**Cryptographic Verification:**
- DAO governance model with transparent decision-making
- Impact metrics verifiable on-chain

**Women's Circle Advisory Team:**
- 3 local + 4 international facilitators
- Professional health curriculum (family planning, SGBV prevention, menstrual health)
- Partnership model with Ugandan social enterprises (Afripads, WoMena)

### 3. Scalability (2026 Growth Trajectory)

**Proven Capacity to Scale:**
- Vermicompost: Ready to expand to more villages (infrastructure in place)
- Mushroom: Training 2-3 new women's groups in Q1 2026
- Biochar: 6x production increase (6,100 kg → 40 tons target 2026)
- Women's Circle: Expanding topics (menstrual cups, pregnancy, waterborne disease)
- Arborloo: 50 units planned (responding to 8,000+ DRC families arrival)

**Why Scalable:**
- Local production chains established (welders fabricate kilns)
- Training manuals tested and validated
- Partnership model proven (UNHCR, Re-Alliance, Mycorama, Afripads)
- Champion farmer model (100 biochar champions training in 2026)

### 4. Cost-Effectiveness

**Leverage Ratio:**
- UNHCR funding (2023) → 501 farmers trained → 7.8 tons/year ongoing production
- Initial mushroom lab investment → 4,800 kg/year production → women paying school fees
- Biochar kilns (fabricated locally) → 6,100 kg → 40 tons target (6x return)

**Multiplier Effect:**
- 1 woman trained in mushroom cultivation → family income → children's education → health knowledge shared
- 1 champion farmer → neighbors adopt (biochar "black gold" spreading organically)
- 1 vermicompost training → 270 farmers report yield increases

### 5. Humanitarian Response (Crisis-Responsive)

**Context:**
- 8,000+ DRC families arrived Nakivale since January 2025
- Only 30% sanitation coverage
- 7L water/household/day (severe shortage)
- Only 18% can wash hands (disease outbreak risk)

**Unidos Response:**
- Arborloo toilet project (50 units, ~250 people)
- Regenerative design (toilets become tree fertilizer)
- Cultural fit (90% prefer squatting, gender-segregated)
- Partnership ready (Re-Alliance collaboration documented)

**Why This Matters:**
- Demonstrates agility (new crisis → new program designed)
- Maintains regenerative approach (even in emergency response)
- Leverages existing partnerships and community trust
