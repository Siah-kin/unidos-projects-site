# Unidos Website Content Updates - Summary

**Date:** February 15, 2026

## What I've Done

I've analyzed all the Unidos project documents from Paulinho's email and created a comprehensive strategy to improve your website content while avoiding AI-generated content pitfalls.

### 📊 Documents Analyzed

1. **Permaculture & Vermicompost Initiative** - UNHCR end-of-project report 2024
2. **Mushroom Project** - Full project contents + testimonials
3. **Women's Circle Project** - Complete project documentation + team profiles
4. **Arborloo Toilet Project** - Proposal + final report
5. **Biochar Project** - Annual report 2025

### 🎯 Water Prompt Principles Applied

I used the "Water Prompt" strategy from Bonzi_v5 repo to avoid AI fingerprints:

**Core Principle:** Never announce what you are. Let people discover what you do.

**The approach:**
- ✅ Describe mechanics (what Unidos does)
- ✅ Use specific numbers and verifiable data
- ✅ Include real names, villages, outcomes
- ✅ Show honest progress (targets vs actuals)
- ❌ Avoid buzzwords: "innovative", "transformative", "revolutionary", "holistic"
- ❌ Remove mission statements from introductions
- ❌ No vague claims without evidence

## 🔑 Key Improvements vs. Current Website

### BEFORE (Generic):
> "Turning Refugees into Change Makers - A refugee-led organization empowering communities through regenerative agriculture, education, and sustainable livelihoods."

**Problems:** Mission statement, buzzwords ("empowering"), vague claims

### AFTER (Specific):
> "Unidos Social Innovation Center - Refugee-led organization in Nakivale, Uganda. Since 2018: trained 3,000+ farmers in food forest design, processed 800 kg food waste weekly into worm compost, taught 700 women to grow oyster mushrooms and make organic soap."

**Why better:** Concrete actions, verifiable numbers, no buzzwords

## 📈 Real Data Highlights

All pages now include specific, verifiable metrics:

**Mushroom Project:**
- 152 women trained across 4 groups
- 4,800 kg mushrooms produced (2024)
- 5,000 kg agricultural waste recycled monthly
- Named person: Furaha Bahati (Eagles Power Group) - pays school fees from mushroom sales

**Women's Circle:**
- 500 women surveyed across 13 villages
- 38 participants, 16 sessions (Sept-Dec 2024)
- 90% improved menstrual hygiene understanding
- Family planning adoption: 23% → 34%
- 6-person facilitator team with full backgrounds

**Biochar:**
- 6,100 kg produced in 2025
- 1,500 kg in reserve for 2026
- 31 farms, biomass collected via tricycles
- Soil drainage improved (better water retention)
- 5 farmers testing in gardens

**Vermicompost (Regesoil):**
- 501 farmers trained (350 women, 151 men)
- 7.8 tons vermicompost yearly
- Soil drainage: 10 cm/hour → 6.5 cm/hour (40% improvement)
- 270 farmers: up to 45% productivity increase
- Missed target: 4 sites instead of 6 (land access issue - stated honestly)

## 🎨 Style Guide Applied

### DO:
✅ Use exact quantities (kg, liters, participants)
✅ Name specific people, villages, partners
✅ Show targets vs actuals (including misses)
✅ Quote testimonials directly (not paraphrased)
✅ Include operational details (tricycles, evening sessions, termite damage)
✅ Cite data sources (UNHCR, OPM, Nsamizi)

### DON'T:
❌ Start with mission statements
❌ Use words: innovative, transformative, holistic, seamlessly, leverage, synergy
❌ Make unverifiable claims
❌ Hide failures
❌ Use passive voice for actions

## 🔍 Data Research Needed

Some statistics need verification/sourcing:

1. **Malnutrition rates:** "2% (2020) → 21% (2023)" - cited as "International Medical Team Uganda"
   - **Action:** Verify source or find UNHCR/WFP official Nakivale data

2. **Settlement population:** Current site says "20,000 refugees served"
   - **Action:** Check if this means direct beneficiaries or total population (likely 100,000+)

3. **Food ration reductions:** "drastically reduced" (founding story 2018)
   - **Action:** Find specific % or date of WFP ration cuts

4. **Sanitation stats:** "30% coverage", "8,000+ families"
   - **Action:** Verify with OPM or UNHCR Nakivale WASH reports

## 📋 Next Steps

### HIGH PRIORITY

1. **Review draft pages** with Paulinho
   - Check all facts, numbers, names
   - Verify testimonial permissions
   - Confirm team member profile details

2. **Add images from Google Drive**
   - Women's Circle: folder provided
   - Mushroom: folder + video (https://youtu.be/sR2xO-FhPDk)
   - Biochar: folder provided
   - Arborloo: folder + video (https://youtu.be/BaEhSzt2RiA)

3. **Update existing pages**
   - Homepage hero text (remove "Change Makers")
   - Programs page (expand mushroom, add 3 new projects)
   - About page (add team profiles)

### MEDIUM PRIORITY

4. **Verify data sources**
   - Research missing statistics
   - Add citations/links

5. **Create proper project pages**
   - Copy drafts to `/stories/` folder
   - Add to programs.html navigation
   - Optimize images for web

6. **Update Mushroom & Vermicompost pages**
   - Add 2024-2025 detailed outcomes
   - Include more testimonials

### LOW PRIORITY

7. **About page expansion**
   - Team member profiles from Women's Circle facilitators
   - Founding story with specific 2018 details

8. **Impact dashboard**
   - Visual metrics display
   - Quarterly updates

## 💡 Why This Approach Works

### Traditional NGO Content:
> "Unidos is pioneering innovative solutions to food insecurity through holistic regenerative agriculture programs that transform communities."

**Problem:** Could describe any NGO. No specific information. AI-generated feel.

### Water Prompt Approach:
> "Unidos trains farmers in Nakivale to build food forests and process waste. Since 2024: 501 farmers trained in 2-week sessions, 7.8 tons worm compost from 800 kg food waste weekly, 4 demonstration sites. Result: 270 farmers report up to 45% yield increases."

**Why better:**
- Specific actions anyone can verify
- Real numbers from real reports
- Shows what actually happens
- Human, credible, trustworthy

## 🎯 Core Message

The Unidos story is powerful because it's **real**:
- 4,800 kg mushrooms harvested
- 340 farmers using food forests
- 40% soil improvement
- Family planning adoption +11%
- School fees paid from mushroom sales
- Babies recovering from malnutrition with mushroom meals

These mechanics speak louder than any "transformative mission" statement.

**Let people discover what Unidos is by seeing what Unidos does.**

## 📞 Questions for Paulinho

1. Do I have permission to use all testimonials quoted? (Furaha, Rosetta, Salima, farmers)
2. Are team member profiles accurate? (especially external advisors)
3. Can you verify the malnutrition statistic source? (2% → 21%)
4. What's the current total Nakivale population vs. Unidos direct beneficiaries?
5. When exactly did WFP reduce food rations (for founding story)?

## ✅ What's Different About This Content

1. **No AI fingerprints** - Real data, real names, real outcomes
2. **Honest about challenges** - Shows what didn't work (4 sites vs 6 target)
3. **Specific mechanics** - Exactly what happens, when, where, how much
