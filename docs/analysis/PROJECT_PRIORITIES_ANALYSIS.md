---

### TIER 3: Emerging/Response (Medium Priority)
**Addressing urgent needs, building toward implementation**

#### 5. Arborloo Toilet Project
**Status:** ⚠️ Proposal/early implementation responding to crisis

**Why Important (Not Yet Pivotal):**
- **Crisis response:** 8,000+ DRC families arrived since January 2025
- **Severe need:** Only 30% sanitation coverage, 7L water/household/day
- **Cultural fit:** 90% prefer squatting, gender-segregated design matches needs
- **Health critical:** Only 18% can wash hands, disease outbreak risk
- **Regenerative design:** Toilets become tree fertilizer after use
- **Partnership:** Re-Alliance collaboration documented

**2026 Status:** Implementation starting, target 50 units (~250 people)
**URL suggestion:** `/programs/sanitation-arborloo` (humanitarian response)

**Why Lower Priority (for now):**
- No production history yet
- Proposal stage (needs funding/implementation)
- Newer than other programs
- **BUT:** Crisis-responsive, could become high-priority fast

2. `/programs/mushroom-lab` - First spawn multiplication lab in Nakivale

**Growing Programs (Tier 2):**
3. `/programs/womens-circle` - Health education and economic integration
4. `/programs/biochar-soil` - Climate-smart soil carbon sequestration

**Response Programs (Tier 3):**
5. `/programs/sanitation-arborloo` - Composting toilets for newly arrived refugees

---

## Why This Prioritization?

### PIVOTAL = Operational + Proven + Scalable

**Most Pivotal (Tier 1):**
1. **Vermicompost/Regesoil** - Largest scale, longest track record, UNHCR validation
2. **Mushroom Lab** - Unique asset, income-generating, malnutrition solution

**Why these lead:**
- Active production (not pilot phase)
- Measurable outcomes over 12+ months
- External partnership validation
- Income generation proven (school fees, sales)
- Infrastructure in place (food forests, lab, kilns)
- Ready to scale immediately

**Growing Pivotal (Tier 2):**
3. **Women's Circle** - Pilot success, community demand proven, professional team
4. **Biochar** - First year complete, scaling 6x in 2026, local production chain established

**Why tier 2:**
- Proven concept but shorter track record
- Clear growth trajectory
- Strong 2026 plans
- Integration with tier 1 programs

**Emerging (Tier 3):**
5. **Arborloo** - Critical need, but implementation just starting

**Why tier 3:**
- Proposal stage
- No production history yet
- Crisis-responsive (could move up fast with funding)

## Integration Synergies (Why Tier System Works)

### Tier 1 feeds Tier 2:
- **Vermicompost** provides inputs for **Biochar** mixing (compost component)
- **Mushroom training** integrates into **Women's Circle** economic programs
- **Food forests** create space for **Arborloo** tree planting after composting

### Women's Circle as hub:
- Participants learn **mushroom cultivation** (income)
- Participants access **permaculture training** (food security)
- Participants get **soap making** skills (existing Unidos program)
- Creates pathway: health education → economic empowerment

### Biochar scales Tier 1:
