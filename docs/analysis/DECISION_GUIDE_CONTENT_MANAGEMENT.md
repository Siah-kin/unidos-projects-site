## ❓ Common Questions

### "Do I need a CMS if I only update content once per month?"
**Answer**: Probably not. Static HTML is fine for occasional updates. CMS adds value if you update weekly or more.

### "Can I use both free Instagram widget AND Juicer.io later?"
**Answer**: Yes! Start with free widget, upgrade to Juicer if it proves valuable. No migration needed (just swap embed codes).

### "What if I don't have Instagram?"
**Answer**: Create one! Refugee-led organizations get high engagement on Instagram. Or use Facebook feed instead (also free options available).

### "Will this slow down my website?"
**Answer**: Slightly (adds ~200-500kb), but modern tools are optimized. Test page load speed before/after using Google PageSpeed Insights.
