# GDPR Compliance Plan: Refugee Data Handling

**Organization**: Unidos Social Innovation Center
**Purpose**: Ensure GDPR-compliant handling of refugee personal data
**Scope**: All refugee beneficiaries, program participants, and staff
**Effective Date**: 2026-02-16
**Review Date**: 2027-02-16 (annual review)

## Executive Summary

While Unidos operates in Uganda (non-EU), GDPR compliance is necessary because:
1. **EU donors** require GDPR compliance for data processing
2. **Some refugees** may have EU citizenship or residency rights
3. **Best practice** for vulnerable population data protection
4. **UNHCR alignment** - UNHCR data policies align with GDPR principles

**Key Requirements**:
- Legal basis for all data processing
- Explicit consent for sensitive data
- Data minimization and purpose limitation
- Security measures appropriate to risk
- Data subject rights (access, erasure, portability)
- Breach notification within 72 hours

- Photos/testimonials: 5 years maximum
- Anonymized data: Can be kept indefinitely

### 4.2 Data Minimization Checklist

Before adding a new data field, ask:

1. [ ] **Is this data absolutely necessary** for the stated purpose?
2. [ ] **Can we achieve the same goal** with less/aggregated data?
3. [ ] **Is there a less intrusive alternative** (e.g., age range instead of DOB)?
4. [ ] **Have we documented the legal basis** for collecting this?
5. [ ] **Do we have appropriate security** for this data type?

If "no" to any question → don't collect it.

---

## 9. Privacy by Design & Default

### 9.1 Privacy by Design Principles

When designing new programs/systems:

1. **Proactive not reactive** - Build privacy in from the start
2. **Privacy as default** - No action needed from beneficiary (opt-out, not opt-in)
3. **Privacy embedded** - Integral to design, not add-on
4. **Positive-sum** - Not privacy vs. functionality (both achievable)
5. **End-to-end security** - Lifecycle protection
6. **Visibility & transparency** - Open about data practices
7. **Respect for user privacy** - User-centric

### 9.2 Implementation Checklist

For every new initiative:

- [ ] **Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)** if high-risk processing
- [ ] **Privacy review** before launch
- [ ] **Default to least data** collection
- [ ] **Pseudonymization** where possible (IDs instead of names)
- [ ] **Encryption** by default
- [ ] **Access controls** from day one
- [ ] **Retention schedule** defined
- [ ] **Consent mechanism** if needed

---

## 10. Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)

### 10.1 When DPIA Required

DPIA mandatory if processing likely to result in high risk:
- ✅ **Sensitive data** (health, ethnicity) → DPIA required
- ✅ **Vulnerable people** (refugees, children) → DPIA required
- ✅ **Large scale** (>1000 people) → DPIA required
- ❌ Ad-hoc small projects (10 people) → DPIA not required

**Unidos programs requiring DPIA**:
1. Women's Circle (health data, vulnerable population)
2. REGESOIL (large scale, photos/testimonials)
3. Any new digital platform (database, app)

### 10.2 DPIA Template

**1. Description of Processing**:
- What: Women's Circle health education sessions
- Who: 700+ refugee women in Nakivale
- Data: Names, ages, attendance, health topics discussed

**2. Necessity & Proportionality**:
- Purpose: Provide health education, track program impact
- Legal basis: Consent (Art. 6(1)(a), Art. 9(2)(a))
- Necessity: Yes, attendance tracking needed for grants
- Less intrusive alternatives: None viable

**3. Risks to Data Subjects**:
| Risk | Likelihood | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|------------|----------|------------|
| Unauthorized disclosure of health data | Medium | High | Encryption, access controls, staff training |
| Discrimination based on leaked data | Low | Very High | Pseudonymization, aggregate reporting only |
| Re-identification of anonymous data | Low | Medium | Remove indirect identifiers (zone + age = individual) |

**4. Measures to Address Risks**:
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- RBAC (only health staff access health data)
- Pseudonymization for reporting
- Regular security audits

**5. Consultation**:
- Beneficiaries: Community feedback session held 2026-01-10
- DPO: Reviewed and approved 2026-01-15
- IT: Security measures confirmed adequate 2026-01-12

**6. Approval & Review**:
- Approved by: Executive Director
- Date: 2026-01-20
- Next review: 2027-01-20 (annual)

---

## 11. Data Retention & Deletion

### 11.1 Retention Schedule

| Data Category | Retention Period | Legal Basis | Deletion Method |
|---------------|------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Program participant data | 7 years after last participation | Tax/financial regulations | Secure deletion (3-pass overwrite) |
| Donor data | 7 years after last donation | Tax/financial regulations | Secure deletion |
| Marketing consent | Until withdrawn | Ongoing relationship | Immediate deletion upon withdrawal |
| Anonymized data | Indefinite | Research/impact (no personal data) | N/A (not personal data) |
| Photos/testimonials | 5 years OR consent withdrawn | Consent | Remove from website, delete files |
| Financial records | 7 years | Legal obligation | Secure deletion after 7 years |

### 11.2 Automated Deletion

**Process**:
1. Database flags records older than retention period
2. Monthly review by Data Protection Officer
3. Verify no legal hold (e.g., ongoing dispute)
4. Execute deletion script
5. Log deletion (who, what, when)
6. Confirm to beneficiary if deletion was requested

**Exception**: Anonymization instead of deletion
- Legitimate interest in longitudinal studies
- Remove all identifiers (name, contact, precise location)
- Retain: Age range, general location (settlement), program participation dates
- No possibility of re-identification

---

## 12. Special Considerations: Minors & Vulnerable Populations

### 12.1 Children's Data (Under 18)

**Extra Protections**:
- ✅ **Parental consent** required for children under 16
- ✅ **Simplified language** in consent forms
- ✅ **Special security** - children's data in separate table with extra encryption
- ✅ **Photos of children** - NEVER without parental consent + child assent
- ✅ **No full faces** in public photos (unless explicit consent)

**Age Verification**:
- Ask age during enrollment
- If under 16, require parent/guardian to sign consent
- If parent unavailable (unaccompanied minor), consult UNHCR guidelines

### 12.2 Vulnerable Adults

**Additional Safeguards**:
- Trauma-informed consent process (no pressure, multiple touchpoints)
- Capacity assessment (can they understand what they're consenting to?)
- Support person present if needed
- Right to withdraw at any time, easily

**Example: Women's Circle**:
- Some participants may be survivors of gender-based violence (GBV)
- Extra care: Private enrollment, staff trained in trauma-informed care
- Anonymity option: Can participate without sharing name publicly

---
