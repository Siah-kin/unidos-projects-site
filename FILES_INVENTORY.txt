================================================================================
SUMMARY OF ISSUES
================================================================================

1. PRIMARY ISSUE: Story Files Location
   - Files are in:  stories/html/
   - Links expect:  stories/
   - Impact:        9 pages inaccessible
   - Broken links:  48 (from various pages linking to stories)

2. SECONDARY ISSUE: Story File Internal Links
   - Each file has: 16 broken links
   - Total impact:  144 broken links (9 files × 16)
   - Cause:         Files too deep in directory structure
   - Effect:        No CSS, no navigation, no images

3. TERTIARY ISSUE: Duplicate Files
   - Files duplicated: 6
   - Locations:        root/ and static/
   - Impact:           Maintenance confusion, SEO issues

4. MINOR ISSUE: Research Portal
   - Broken links:  6
   - Missing pages: All research content pages
   - Impact:        Limited (portal not heavily used)

5. NAMING ISSUE: Outdated Navigation
   - Old names:     stories.html, diary.html
   - New names:     blog.html, history.html
   - Impact:        Story files still link to old names

================================================================================
THE FIX
================================================================================

Step 1: Move files from stories/html/ to stories/
  Command: mv stories/html/*.html stories/

Step 2: Update navigation in each story file
  Change: ../stories.html → ../blog.html
  Change: ../diary.html → ../history.html

Step 3: Remove duplicate
  Command: rm stories/biochar.html (keep the one that was in html/)

Step 4: Remove empty directory
  Command: rmdir stories/html

Result: 192 broken links → 0 broken links

================================================================================
