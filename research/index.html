            <h3>Why this works in Nakivale</h3>
            <p><strong>Land</strong> is allocated by UNHCR - not purchased. <strong>Compost</strong> is made from organic waste - free. <strong>Water</strong> is available at settlement boreholes. <strong>Training</strong> - Unidos already taught 501 people exactly these techniques. The bottleneck was never knowledge. It was the first $10 to buy inputs.</p>

            <h3>What kills it without help</h3>
            <p>A wholesaler drives in, offers half the market price. The farmer has no price reference. Accepts. Revenue drops 43%. Or: the farmer has surplus mushrooms but no buyer. They spoil in 2 days. Total loss. Or: a health emergency wipes savings back to zero.</p>
            <p>This is why the compounding cycle needs three things beyond the $10: <strong>price information</strong> (what are mushrooms actually selling for today?), <strong>buyer connections</strong> (who needs 25kg this week?), and <strong>a safety floor</strong> (the passive $10 that prevents total reset after a bad month).</p>

            <h3>The pilot: 10 people, 12 months</h3>
            <p>We want to coach 10 farmers through this cycle and track everything: what they plant, what they harvest, what they sell, what they save, and what goes wrong. Not a controlled experiment in a lab - a real test with real people facing real problems.</p>

        <!-- RESEARCH 2: Data as Collateral -->
        <!-- ============================================ -->
        <div class="research-card">
            <h2>Research 2: Turning helpful data into economic opportunity</h2>
            <p class="lead">When a farmer uses a tool to check prices, list products, or answer a neighbor's question about compost - that activity generates data. We are researching whether that data can serve as a form of collateral to unlock small loans, better prices, and community credit - without needing a bank account or government ID.</p>

            <h3>How cooperation becomes trust</h3>
            <p>The farmer is already doing the work - planting, harvesting, answering a neighbor's question about compost ratios, reporting what mushrooms sold for at the market this week. We track patterns in that activity:</p>
            <ul style="margin: 12px 0 12px 24px; font-size: 15px; color: #444;">
                <li><strong>Frequency</strong> - How often does this person contribute useful information?</li>
                <li><strong>Quality</strong> - Do their price reports match what other users report? Do their answers help?</li>
                <li><strong>Consistency</strong> - Do they show up week after week, or only when they need something?</li>
                <li><strong>Reciprocity</strong> - Do they help others as much as they ask for help?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Over time, these patterns produce a <strong>trust profile</strong>. Not a credit score from a bank - a behavioral record built from real activity the person already does.</p>

            <h3>What a trust profile unlocks</h3>
            <p>The principle: your own behavior already proved you are trustworthy. Here is what that unlocks:</p>
            <ul style="margin: 12px 0 12px 24px; font-size: 15px; color: #444;">
                <li><strong>Better prices</strong> - Trusted sellers get priority in listings. Buyers see their track record before negotiating.</li>
                <li><strong>Input credit</strong> - A farmer with 30 verified interactions gets spawn bags on credit. Someone with 5 does not. The threshold is transparent.</li>
                <li><strong>Peer vouching</strong> - A trusted farmer can vouch for a newcomer. If the newcomer defaults, both records reflect it. Trust is shared, not just individual.</li>
                <li><strong>Bulk access</strong> - Farmers with consistent records pool orders for fertilizer or transport, cutting costs that no individual can negotiate alone.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The closed loop</h3>
            <p>What makes this different from other research: the data is the product AND the proof. The farmer is not filling out surveys for researchers. They are using a tool that helps them sell mushrooms - and the usage data itself becomes three things at once:</p>

            <div class="loop-box">
                <p><span class="arrow">1.</span> <strong>Their credit record</strong> - proving trustworthiness without a bank ID</p>
                <p><span class="arrow">2.</span> <strong>A research dataset</strong> - agricultural knowledge, market prices, cooperation patterns (anonymized, never individual identities exposed)</p>

            <h3>The bigger picture: data as collateral for community loans</h3>
            <p>We collect anonymized, privacy-protected data in a shared pool. This pool becomes a form of collateral - proof that a community is productive, cooperative, and creditworthy. Against that collateral, we can issue small loans to give new projects a kick-start budget. When the farmer repays after harvest, the repayment adds to their trust profile, which unlocks better terms next time.</p>
            <p>The long-term vision: these cooperation patterns, tracked over years, become a kind of heritage. A lineage of trustworthy behavior that compounds across seasons and across generations. The community builds something that belongs to them - not to a bank, not to an NGO, not to a platform.</p>
