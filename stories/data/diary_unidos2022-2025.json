    "A recent UN (UNHCR) report says that approximately 16,000 new refugees arrived at the Nakivale Refugee Camp in Uganda between March and August 2022. \nThis influx has resulted in further shortages of food, which has in turn led to conflicts between refugees and Ugandan farmers, who have accused refugees of stealing food from local farms. \n\nIn October 2021, the monthly stipend for Nakivale refugees was reduced by almost a third from 19,000 Ugandan shillings ($5) to 13,000 shillings ($3.40), says Abdirahman Meygag, the World Food Program (WFP) representative and country director for Uganda.   \n\nAt UNIDOS, we and our partners are committed to responding to this challenge in several ways. \nFirst, by educating refugees about the more efficient and productive regenerative agricultural approach and also by providing adequate tools and seeds. \nSecondly, by inviting people to co-create a resilient community where everyone will be able to grow their own food. \nAnd third, to grow additional food for general consumption and create businesses to generate income from this that could help respond to other basic needs.  \n \nWe would be pleased to have you join our cause and help end food scarcity in Nakivale and elsewhere in the world with the tools and methods we have and are developing and will be sharing with the world.  \n \nThere are different ways to help, including donating to our cause and volunteering with us.\nYou can contact us in the following way: ",

     "text": "A recent UN (UNHCR) report says that approximately 16,000 new refugees arrived at the Nakivale Refugee Camp in Uganda between March and August 2022. \nThis influx has resulted in further shortages of food, which has in turn led to conflicts between refugees and Ugandan farmers, who have accused refugees of stealing food from local farms. \n\nIn October 2021, the monthly stipend for Nakivale refugees was reduced by almost a third from 19,000 Ugandan shillings ($5) to 13,000 shillings ($3.40), says Abdirahman Meygag, the World Food Program (WFP) representative and country director for Uganda.   \n\nAt UNIDOS, we and our partners are committed to responding to this challenge in several ways. \nFirst, by educating refugees about the more efficient and productive regenerative agricultural approach and also by providing adequate tools and seeds. \nSecondly, by inviting people to co-create a resilient community where everyone will be able to grow their own food. \nAnd third, to grow additional food for general consumption and create businesses to generate income from this that could help respond to other basic needs.  \n \nWe would be pleased to have you join our cause and help end food scarcity in Nakivale and elsewhere in the world with the tools and methods we have and are developing and will be sharing with the world.  \n \nThere are different ways to help, including donating to our cause and volunteering with us.\nYou can contact us in the following way: "

    "🌍💪 Empowering Refugee Women: Unidos Bridges the Gap in Nakivale Refugee Settlement 💪🌍\n\nDid you know that in the global population of displaced people, women and girls make up a significant portion? In Nakivale refugee settlement, home to over 150,000 refugees, 50% of the population consists of women. Unfortunately, these individuals face immense vulnerability not only due to displacement but also due to the lack of economic opportunities, which hinders their ability to support their families.\n\nBut there's hope! Meet Mariam Antoine, the head of women's empowerment at Unidos. She passionately explains how Unidos is bridging the gap and empowering women to reclaim their power and contribute to the well-being of their community.\n\nAt Unidos, we understand that empowering women means empowering entire communities. Through our programs and initiatives, we provide the necessary tools and resources for women in Nakivale to gain financial independence and build a better future for themselves and their families.\n\nFrom teaching regenerative agriculture and permaculture to organizing soap-making classes, we empower women to become self-sufficient and establish their own businesses. By harnessing the power of sustainable practices and natural resources, we not only address immediate needs but also create long-term solutions.\n\nJoin us in supporting Mariam and the incredible women of Nakivale.

    "Join Us in Supporting UNIDOS - Empowering Refugees through Regenerative Agriculture and Permaculture🤝\n\nDear Friends,\n\nI hope this message finds you well. I wanted to share some important information with you regarding a community called UNIDOS, dedicated to teaching regenerative agriculture and permaculture to the residents of the Nakivale refugee settlement in Uganda.\n\nInitially reliant on food aid from different humanitarian Organisations, UNIDOS has taken significant strides towards independence. However, with support dwindling to just 13000 UGX, equivalent to a mere $3.48 per month, it has become increasingly challenging for the approximately 150,000 people in the settlement to sustain themselves.\n\nOver the past few years, UNIDOS has made remarkable progress in organizing and educating refugees on growing their own food using permaculture principles. This approach fosters independence and empowers individuals through sustainable practices. Additionally, the organization has been conducting soap-making classes, particularly benefiting women, to help them establish their own businesses.\n\nTo further advance our mission, UNIDOS is planning a fundraising event in the near future and hopes to garner support through organic growth. The team is currently seeking influencers with the right credentials who could help amplify our message and increase their online visibility. While there is no financial compensation involved, we would greatly appreciate your voluntary assistance in spreading the word about their cause.\n\nBefore committing, I encourage you to explore our website at ",

If you'd like to reach out to UNIDOS directly, you can find our contact details on their website, or feel free to reply to this message.\n\nThank you for your consideration. We look forward to hearing from you and joining forces to support this meaningful cause.\n\nWarm regards,\nPaulinho Muzaliwa"

The dry season has now extended for eight long months, and there is no certainty when the rain will finally arrive.\n\nThe prolonged dry season is a pressing issue as time waits for no one. With each passing day, the situation becomes more critical, and the rain remains elusive.

One effective method is planting nitrogen-fixing crops and trees, enriching the soil ecosystem and reducing the need for synthetic nitrogen fertilizers in agriculture.\n\n🌳 Exciting Update!

Today, we're thrilled to announce a harvest of almost 100kg from a compact 20 square meters!

I'm excited to amplify the important work we're doing and shed light on the challenges and triumphs faced by refugees.\n\nA special shoutout to Suzanne and the USA for UNHCR team for their support.\nThank you all for being part of this incredible journey. Together, we can make a difference. 🌟🌈\n\n",

    "Did you know that vermicomposting is one of the safest and most eco-friendly methods for managing organic waste? This bioremediation process, facilitated by earthworms, converts organic waste into nutrient-rich compost sustainably.\n\nEarthworms aren't just soil dwellers; they're vital waste decomposers, playing crucial roles in maintaining ecological balance. When we engage communities in food waste recycling, we not only mitigate environmental degradation risks but also create part-time job opportunities, especially for young people in refugee settlements where unemployment rates are as high as 40%.\n\nMoreover, through vermicomposting, we produce organic fertilizer rich in nutrients. This benefits farmers by reducing the need for agro-chemical inputs and helps regenerate soil, making it more productive in the long run.\n\nLet's embrace sustainable practices like vermicomposting to nurture our environment, create economic opportunities, and support agriculture for a healthier, greener future! 🌱 \n",

We consider several vital points that shape its success:\n\n1. Efficient Use of Space: Our food forest is a multi-layered ecosystem, mirroring natural forests. Every inch is carefully planned to maximize productivity and biodiversity.\n\n2. Ecosystem Resilience: Thoughtful design enhances resilience by promoting biodiversity and providing habitat for beneficial organisms, reducing vulnerability to pests and diseases.\n\n3. Sustainable Resource Management: We incorporate water catchment, soil conservation, and nutrient cycling into our design, minimizing reliance on external inputs and reducing environmental impact.\n\n4. Accessibility and Maintenance: Our food forest is designed for ease of access and maintenance. Proper layout and spacing make it simple to navigate and care for, ensuring longevity and productivity.\n\n5. Community Inclusion: We involve our community every step of the way, from design to implementation and decision-making. Together, we co-create a space that serves as a hub for engagement and education.\n\nJoin us in nurturing our food forest and cultivating a sustainable future for all!\n\n",

Even in places often described as hopeless, like refugee camps, regeneration is happening.\n\nRefugees, we are not waiting for help. We are building solutions.

We lived through COVID-19, shrinking humanitarian aid, climate shocks, and deep food insecurity—but our community kept rising.\n\nToday, thousands of refugees have been empowered through UNIDOS. We’ve restored land, created jobs, supported farmers, built youth leadership, and cultivated regenerative food systems. What started as survival has become a global example of resilience and community innovation.\n\nAs UNIDOS celebrates 6 years, we choose to honor this journey by sharing food with 200 newly arrived refugees—people who are starting from zero, just like we once did.\n\nYou can celebrate with us.\n$5 feeds one person.\nDonate here:\n",
