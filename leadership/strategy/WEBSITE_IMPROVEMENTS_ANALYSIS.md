## Water Prompt Principles Applied to Unidos

### Core Principle
**Never announce what you are. Let people discover what you do.**

### The Five Tests for Unidos Content

1. **Specificity Test** - Can this claim be verified?
   - ✅ "152 women trained in mushroom cultivation"
   - ✅ "4,800 kg of mushrooms produced in 2024"
   - ✅ "61 sacks of biochar produced June-August 2025"
   - ❌ "Innovative sustainable solutions"

2. **Protest Sign Test** - Could this appear on a protest banner?
   - ❌ "Turning refugees into change makers" (mission statement)
   - ✅ "800 kg food waste recycled weekly into worm compost"

3. **Mechanics First** - Does it describe WHAT (not WHY)?
   - ✅ "2-week training: permaculture design, seed conservation, tools provided"
   - ❌ "Empowering communities through regenerative agriculture"

4. **No Comparisons** - Avoid positioning against others
   - ✅ "Here's what we do." (Let readers compare)
   - ❌ "Unlike other NGOs..."

5. **Adversarial Test** - Survives cynical readers?
   - ✅ "340 farmers adopted food forest methods (68% of 500 target)"
   - ❌ "Revolutionary approach to refugee empowerment"

---

## Current Website: What to Keep vs. Change

### ✅ KEEP (Already follows Water Prompt)
- Specific numbers: "20,000 refugees served", "700 women empowered"
- Geographic specificity: "Nakivale Refugee Settlement, Isingiro District, Uganda"
- Founding date: "established in 2018"
- Team size: "35 full- and part-time employees"

### ❌ REMOVE/REPLACE (AI fingerprints & mission statements)

**Banned words currently on site:**
- "innovative" (appears multiple times)
- "empowering" (overused)
- "sustainable" (vague without specifics)
- "holistic approach"
- "transform lives"

**Generic phrases to replace:**
- "Turning refugees into change makers" → Describe what actually happens
- "Creating lasting change" → Show specific before/after metrics
- "Comprehensive initiatives" → List actual program components

## Specific Content Improvements by Page

### Homepage

**CURRENT PROBLEM:**
```html
<h1>Turning Refugees into <span class="highlight">Change Makers</span></h1>
<p>A refugee-led organization empowering communities through regenerative
agriculture, education, and sustainable livelihoods in Nakivale, Uganda.</p>
```

**WATER PROMPT FIX:**
```html
<h1>Unidos Social Innovation Center</h1>
<p>Refugee-led organization in Nakivale, Uganda. Since 2018: trained 3,000+
farmers in food forest design, processed 800 kg food waste weekly into worm
compost, taught 700 women to grow oyster mushrooms and make organic soap.</p>
```

**Why better:** Removes mission language ("change makers", "empowering"), adds specific mechanics (what we actually do), includes verifiable numbers.

---

### Programs Page

**ADD MISSING PROJECTS:**

Currently missing:
- Women's Circle Project (menstrual health + reproductive education)
- Arborloo Toilet Project (sanitation crisis response)
- Biochar Project (soil carbon + climate adaptation)

**IMPROVE EXISTING SECTIONS:**

**Current Mushroom Section:**
```
"In partnership with Re-Alliance and Mycorama, Unidos has trained groups
of refugee women to grow oyster mushrooms using sustainable methods."
```

**Water Prompt Fix:**
```
"Mushroom Spawn Multiplication Lab - Nakivale's First

Since 2024:
- 152 women trained across 4 groups
- 4,800 kg oyster mushrooms harvested
- 5,000 kg agricultural waste recycled monthly (maize stems, cotton husks)
- Products: fresh mushrooms, mushroom wine, flour porridge for malnourished children

Eagles Power Group (15 women, led by Furaha Bahati): First cohort, now earning
school fees from mushroom sales.

Partners: Re-Alliance, Mycorama, UNHCR"
```

**Why better:**
- Specific production numbers
- Concrete waste volumes
- Named products
- Real person (Furaha Bahati) with real outcome (school fees)
- Partners listed factually, not as validation

## Data Research Needs

### 1. Malnutrition Statistics
**Current citation:** "child malnutrition rates rising from 2% in 2020 to 21% in 2023 according to International Medical Team Uganda"

**Action needed:** Verify this citation or find UNHCR/WFP official data for Nakivale specifically.

### 2. Food Ration Reductions
**Mentioned:** "food rations were drastically reduced" (founding story)

**Action needed:** Find specific % or date when WFP reduced rations in Nakivale (likely 2017-2018).

### 3. Current Settlement Population
**Current:** "serves over 20,000 refugees"

**Action needed:** Get current official population from UNHCR Nakivale dashboard (likely 100,000+). The 20,000 may be direct beneficiaries - clarify.

### 4. Sanitation Statistics
**From toilet proposal:** "30% sanitation coverage", "8,000+ families arrived since January"

**Action needed:** Verify with OPM (Office of Prime Minister) or UNHCR Nakivale WASH reports.

## Avoiding AI Fingerprints - Specific Tactics

### 1. Use Human Imperfection
- Show targets missed: "We only made 4 demonstration sites instead of 6"
- Explain why: "getting land in Nakivale is currently a big process due to influx"
- This builds credibility vs. AI "everything is perfect"

### 2. Use Local Context
- Village names: "Kabazana A&B", "Kigali village", "Sudan village", "New Hope", "Kashojwa"
- Local terms: "Kon-Tiki kiln", "Arborloo", "Ecosan toilet"
- Specific crops: "bull's heart fruit", "moringa leaves"

### 3. Use Direct Testimony Format
Don't paraphrase. Use actual quotes:

**BAD (AI-ish):**
"Participants expressed enthusiasm about the transformative impact of the training."

**GOOD (Human):**
"Thanks to Unidos trainers for the knowledge and skills that enabled me to treat
my baby and restore her health." - Rosetta Nzonga, whose malnourished baby started
walking after 2 months of mushroom sauce meals.

### 4. Include Operational Details
- "evening work sessions" (biochar production - too hot during day)
- "tricycles" (biomass transport method)
- "termite damage and unexpected rainfall" (real obstacles)
- "price negotiations with welders: 350,000 Ugx → 500,000 Ugx"

### 5. Use Passive Construction Sparingly
**BAD:** "Food security is being improved through innovative approaches"
**GOOD:** "270 farmers increased yields by up to 45%"

---

## Priority Recommendations

### HIGH PRIORITY (Do First)

1. **Create 3 new project pages:**
   - Women's Circle Project
   - Biochar Project
   - Arborloo Toilet Project

2. **Update homepage hero text:**
   - Remove "Turning Refugees into Change Makers"
   - Add specific mechanics overview

3. **Audit all pages for banned vocabulary:**
   - Find & replace AI fingerprint words
   - Add specific metrics where vague claims exist

### MEDIUM PRIORITY

4. **Add data citations:**
   - Research missing statistics
   - Link to UNHCR, OPM, WFP sources

5. **Expand Mushroom & Vermicompost pages:**
   - Add 2024-2025 detailed outcomes
   - Include more testimonials with context

### LOW PRIORITY

6. **About page:**
   - Add team member profiles (from Women's Circle facilitators)
   - Include founding story with specific details (2018, food ration cuts)

7. **Create impact dashboard:**
   - Visual display of all metrics
   - Updated quarterly

## Example: Before/After Content Comparison

### BEFORE (Generic, AI fingerprint)

> "Unidos is pioneering innovative solutions to food insecurity through
> holistic regenerative agriculture programs that transform communities
> and create sustainable livelihoods for refugees."

**Fails Water Prompt:**
- "pioneering" (banned comparison)
- "innovative" (banned buzzword)
- "holistic" (banned buzzword)
- "transform" (banned buzzword)
- "sustainable" (vague without specifics)
- No verifiable claims
- Pure mission, no mechanics

### AFTER (Specific, Water Prompt compliant)

> "Unidos trains farmers in Nakivale to build food forests and process waste.
> Since 2024: 501 farmers trained in 2-week sessions, 7.8 tons worm compost
> produced yearly from 800 kg food waste weekly, 4 demonstration sites across
> Kabazana A&B and Kigali village. Result: 270 farmers report up to 45% yield
> increases, soil water retention improved 40% (10 cm/hour → 6.5 cm/hour drainage)."

**Passes Water Prompt:**
- ✅ Specific numbers (501, 7.8 tons, 800 kg, 4 sites)
- ✅ Specific metrics (45% yield, 40% retention)
- ✅ Verifiable outcomes (drainage rate change)
- ✅ Mechanics described (what we do: train, process, demonstrate)
- ✅ Real locations (village names)
- ✅ No buzzwords
- ✅ Survives adversarial reading

## Conclusion

The Unidos story is powerful because it's **real**. The current website dilutes this power with generic mission language that could apply to any NGO.

By applying Water Prompt principles:
- **Remove** aspirational buzzwords
- **Add** specific mechanics and measurements
- **Show** real people with real names and real outcomes
- **State** targets honestly, including what didn't work

This approach makes Unidos stand out not by claiming to be different, but by **showing** what actually happens in Nakivale when refugees get training, tools, and support.

The numbers tell the story: 4,800 kg mushrooms harvested, 340 farmers using food forests, 40% soil improvement, family planning adoption up from 23% to 34%. These mechanics speak louder than any mission statement.

**Let people discover what Unidos is by seeing what Unidos does.**
