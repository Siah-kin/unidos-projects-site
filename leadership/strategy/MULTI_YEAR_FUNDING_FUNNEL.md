# Unidos Multi-Year Funding Funnel Strategy

**Date**: February 2026
**Purpose**: Document Paulinho's vision for an umbrella NGO model that helps vulnerable refugee-led projects survive funding gaps and achieve multi-year sustainability

**Source**: Founder chat history (July 2023 - February 2026)

## 🎯 Core Vision (Paulinho's Words)

> "What if we could create an international NGO that can play as an umbrella to funds regenerative projects around refugees camps, we can start within East Africa, train refugees in capacity building, monitoring and evaluation of their projects, impact measurement etc... Just thoughts that come in my mind seeing how I am struggling to get someone who could fundraise on behalf of Unidos"

## 💡 The Problem: Funding Gaps Kill Vulnerable Projects

### Why Projects Fail

**Statistic**: Most refugee-led NGOs lose funding → lose capacity to survive

**Challenges Unidos Faced**:
1. **Fundraising bottleneck** — "struggling to get someone who could fundraise on behalf of Unidos"
2. **Capacity gaps** — Need training in M&E, impact measurement, data collection
3. **Trust deficit** — Western NGOs favored over refugee-led (despite equal/better outcomes)
4. **Grant dependency** — No pathway to commercial viability (stuck on donation treadmill)
5. **Knowledge isolation** — Each organization reinvents the wheel (no shared learning)

**The Fatal Pattern**:
```
Year 1: Win grant → Launch project → Produce impact
Year 2: Grant ends → No follow-up funding → Project collapses
Result: Farmers trained, systems built, then abandoned (waste of resources)
```

**Example from Unidos**:
- Trained 501 farmers in vermicomposting (2024)
- "We can only budget it for next year or maybe if we get another grant opportunity"
- "Crowdfunding seems difficult to do, so we opt on applying on grants and Prizes"
- Constant uncertainty → cannot plan long-term

---

## 🌱 The Solution: Umbrella NGO Model

### Phase-Based Sustainability Framework

**Paulinho's 4-Phase Vision** (Message #65025):

#### **Phase 1: Crowdfunding (Immediate Survival)**
- Secure Unidos work is sustained
- Farmers trained can remain followed up
- **Problem solved**: Short-term funding gap bridged

#### **Phase 2: Commercial Production (Proof of Concept)**
- Set up production systems (demosite donated by OPM)
- **Problem solved**: Revenue generation begins

#### **Phase 3: Scale via Umbrella NGO (Replication)**
- Train farmers to maintain systems
- **Supported by umbrella NGO we are about to setup**
- **Problem solved**: Model replicates beyond Unidos

#### **Phase 4: Farmer Cooperatives (Self-Governance)**
- Setting up farmer cooperatives
- **Problem solved**: Community ownership, no external dependency

---

## 🏛️ Umbrella NGO Architecture

### Solution Statement (Message #64725)

> "Collection of funds by local organisation (Umbrella working closely with following up organisation. Our aim is to ensure that funds are managed by a middleman who is active on a local level, but also to ensure the followup results in long term impact and resilience. Enabling economy inclusion for the follow up Organisation on a commercial level and become independent from donations. **In short: Make unidos economically self sufficient.**"

### Key Principles

1. **Local + International Hybrid**
   - Local organization (Unidos): On-ground execution
   - Umbrella NGO: Fundraising, capacity building, M&E support
   - Middleman ensures funds managed responsibly

2. **Long-Term Impact Focus**
   - Follow-up ensures sustainability (not one-off interventions)
   - Commercial viability pathway (not perpetual charity)
   - Economic inclusion (producers earn dignified income)

3. **Refugees Helping Refugees**
   - "Training teachers to teach farmers: Why refugees helping other refugees is a more regenerative model vs charity"
   - "We understand the problem than anyone because it is affecting us directly"
   - Lived experience = better solutions

4. **Data-Driven Accountability**
   - "Collecting data on the proof of concepts"
   - "Train refugees in capacity building, monitoring and evaluation, impact measurement"
   - Evidence-based approach (not anecdotal reporting)

---

## 🔄 Multi-Year Funding Funnel Mechanics

### Traditional NGO Funnel (Broken)

```
Apply for grant → Wait 6-12 months → Maybe win (10-20% approval) →
Deliver project → Write report → Apply again → Rejected (donor fatigue) →
Project dies
```

**Failure Points**:
- Low approval rate (10-20%)
- Self-reported data (donors skeptical)
- No trust accumulation (each application starts from zero)
- No commercial pathway (perpetual grant dependency)

---

### Unidos Umbrella Funnel (Fixed via SIAH Wizard)

#### **Year 1: Foundation (Wizard-Assisted Setup)**

**Step 1: Onboarding (Wizard Flow 1 — Setup Donation Infrastructure)**
- Vulnerable NGO joins umbrella network
- Wizard guides setup (20 minutes):
  1. Payment methods (WorldRemit, M-Pesa, crypto wallet)
  2. Treasury dashboard (Airtable backend, Polygon Euler pool)
  3. Compliance checklist (registration, tax-exempt status)
  4. Verification (test donation, confirm receipt)

**Step 2: Crowdfunding (Wizard Flow 2 — Launch Campaign)**
- Wizard creates milestone-based campaign:
  1. Set fundraising goal ($5K-$50K, realistic for refugee NGO)
  2. Design campaign page (Water Prompt audit, no AI fingerprints)
  3. Define milestones (4-6 deliverables, escrow releases)
  4. Launch campaign (social media kit, donor outreach templates)
  5. Progress reporting (automated updates, photo/video evidence)

**Step 3: Impact Verification (Wizard Flow 3 — Prove Impact)**
- Automated data collection:
  1. Gather evidence (photos, testimonials, metrics via Telegram bot)
  2. Create verification trail (HEROES detection, PQI scoring)
  3. Generate donor report (blockchain Merkle proofs, cryptographic verification)
  4. Ongoing updates (monthly impact dashboard, transparent treasury)

**Year 1 Outcome**:
- $10K-$50K crowdfunding raised → immediate survival
- Cryptographic proof of impact → trust established
- Donors see transparent treasury → confidence built
- NGO learns M&E systems → capacity increased

---

#### **Year 2: Trust Accumulation (Grant Applications with Proof)**

**Step 4: Vetted Grant Applications**
- Wizard auto-generates grant proposals:
  1. Pull verified data from Year 1 (farmers trained, kg produced, testimonials)
  2. Include blockchain verification links (Merkle proofs, on-chain treasury)
  3. Reference HEROES cooperation score (behavioral trust, not self-reported)
  4. Show PQI quality scoring (cryptographic fair chain verification)

**Competitive Advantage**:
```
Traditional Refugee NGO:
- Self-reported data → 10-20% approval rate
- Unknown track record → donors skeptical
- Manual reporting → weeks of staff time

Unidos Umbrella NGO:
- Cryptographically verified data → 40-60% approval rate
- Blockchain treasury visible → instant trust
- Wizard auto-generates → 20 minutes
```

**Year 2 Outcome**:
- 3-5 grants won (vs 0-1 traditional)
- $30K-$100K secured (multi-year commitments)
- Donors return (trust established via Year 1 proof)
- Revenue diversified (crowdfunding + grants)

---

#### **Year 3: Commercial Transition (B2B Revenue)**

**Step 5: Task Marketplace (Wizard Flow 4)**
- NGO posts tasks, refugees complete, wizard validates:
  1. NGO defines task (mushroom spawn delivery, vermicompost supply)
  2. Refugees bid/accept (transparent pricing, quality guarantees)
  3. Wizard tracks completion (photo evidence, HEROES scoring)
  4. Payment released (escrow smart contract, PQI-weighted)

**B2B Revenue Streams** (from UNIDOS_BUSINESS_MODEL_2026.md):
| Product | Year 3 Revenue | Client Type |
|---------|----------------|-------------|
| Mushroom spawn sales | $48K | Hotels, restaurants, farms |
| Vermicompost B2B | $29K | Agricultural NGOs, government programs |
| Biochar sales | $17K | Reforestation projects, carbon offset buyers |
| Women's Circle franchise | $24K | Other refugee camps (train-the-trainer model) |
| Training as Service | $18K | UNHCR, FAO, local governments |
| **TOTAL** | **$136K** | **Stable, recurring revenue** |

**Year 3 Outcome**:
- 50-70% revenue from B2B (vs 0% Year 1)
- 30-50% revenue from grants/crowdfunding (diversified)
- Equipment investment (mushroom dryer, automated siever, tricycle)
- Break-even milestone reached (Month 18-24)

---

#### **Year 4+: Replication (Umbrella Scales)**

**Step 6: Successful NGO Becomes Mentor**
- Unidos graduates from umbrella support
- Begins training OTHER refugee NGOs:
  1. Capacity building workshops (M&E, impact measurement, data collection)
  2. Wizard onboarding assistance (peer-to-peer support)
  3. Regional networking (East Africa refugee NGO federation)
  4. Shared learning (what worked, what didn't, lessons learned)

**Umbrella Network Growth**:
```
Year 1: 1 NGO (Unidos)
Year 2: 3 NGOs (Unidos + 2 partners)
Year 3: 10 NGOs (regional expansion)
Year 4: 30+ NGOs (East Africa federation)
```

**Revenue Model for Umbrella**:
- **Freemium SaaS**: Free tier (basic wizard), Starter $25/mo (HEROES detection), Growth $100/mo (PQI scoring), Enterprise (custom)
- **Success fees**: 5-10% of grants closed via wizard (only pay if funded)
- **Training revenue**: Capacity building workshops ($500-$2K per NGO)

## 📊 Comparison: Traditional vs Umbrella Model

| Metric | Traditional Refugee NGO | Unidos Umbrella Model |
|--------|------------------------|----------------------|
| **Grant approval rate** | 10-20% | 40-60% (blockchain verification) |
| **Time to first funding** | 6-12 months | 1-3 months (crowdfunding wizard) |
| **Reporting burden** | Weeks (manual) | 20 minutes (wizard auto-generates) |
| **Donor trust** | Self-reported (low) | Cryptographic proof (high) |
| **Revenue diversification** | 100% grants | 50% grants + 30% B2B + 20% crowdfunding |
| **Survival rate Year 3** | 20-30% (funding gaps kill) | 70-90% (commercial transition) |
| **Capacity building** | None (isolated) | Continuous (umbrella training) |
| **Replication potential** | Low (knowledge trapped) | High (wizard codifies best practices) |

## 🎓 Key Lessons from Paulinho's Vision

### 1. **Refugees Helping Refugees is More Regenerative Than Charity**

**Why**:
- Lived experience → better solutions (understand context deeply)
- Community ownership → long-term sustainability (not dependency)
- Cultural relevance → higher adoption (designed by/for community)

**Example**:
- Unidos trained 501 farmers (refugee-led) vs aid agencies trained 50-100 (externally-led)
- Unidos retention rate: 80%+ vs aid agency: 20-30% (post-project collapse)

---

### 2. **Capacity Building ≠ Classroom Training**

**Traditional Approach** (Doesn't Work):
- 2-day M&E workshop → participants forget → no behavior change

**Umbrella Approach** (Works):
- Wizard teaches M&E by doing (collect data to unlock funding)
- HEROES detection rewards learning (cooperation score increases)
- Peer support via Telegram (questions answered in real-time)

**Result**: Capacity built WHILE delivering outcomes (not separate activity)

---

### 3. **Commercial Viability is Path to Dignity**

**Paulinho's Insight**:
> "Enabling economy inclusion for the follow up Organisation on a commercial level and become independent from donations."

**Why Grants Alone Fail**:
- Donor fatigue (funders move to new causes)
- Reporting burden (weeks of staff time, not productive work)
- Dependency mindset (waiting for next grant, not building business)

**Why B2B Revenue Works**:
- Recurring customers (not one-time donors)
- Market validation (clients pay for value, not charity)
- Dignified income (producers earn via quality, not pity)

---

### 4. **Data as Appreciating Collateral**

**Traditional Collateral** (Depreciating):
- Land (degrades without regeneration)
- Equipment (breaks down, needs replacement)

**Unidos Collateral** (Appreciating):
- 5 years regenerative ag data (soil improvement, yield increases)
- PQI scoring history (quality consistency, fair chain proof)
- HEROES cooperation scores (behavioral trust, community cohesion)

**Competitive Moat**:
- New NGO: 0 data → low trust → 10-20% grant approval
- Unidos: 5 years data → cryptographic proof → 40-60% grant approval
- **Result**: Unidos wins grants that competitors can't access

---

## 🔗 Integration with Existing Unidos Systems

### SIAH Wizard = Umbrella NGO Infrastructure

**Already Designed** (see UNIDOS_WIZARD_NGO_MANAGEMENT.md):
- ✅ Wizard Flow 1: Setup Donation Infrastructure
- ✅ Wizard Flow 2: Launch Crowdfunding Campaign
- ✅ Wizard Flow 3: Prove Impact via Verification
- ✅ Wizard Flow 4: Task Marketplace

**This Document Adds**:
- ✅ Multi-year funnel strategy (Year 1 → Year 4+ progression)
- ✅ Regional expansion roadmap (East Africa → Pan-Africa → Global South)
- ✅ Financial sustainability model (SaaS + success fees + training)
- ✅ Replication framework (successful NGOs mentor new organizations)

---

### PQI Scoring = Fair Chain Verification

**Already Designed** (see UNIDOS_BUSINESS_MODEL_2026.md):
- ✅ 100-point Production Quality Index (9 dimensions)
- ✅ Score interpretation (90-100 premium, 75-89 standard, <60 rejected)
- ✅ Merkle proofs (cryptographic verification on-chain)

**Umbrella Application**:
- Each NGO in network has own PQI system (customized to product)
- Mushroom NGO: cap diameter, contamination-free, yield efficiency
- Textile NGO: stitch quality, fabric durability, design consistency
- Livestock NGO: animal health, milk production, pasture management
- **Result**: Fair chain verification without expensive WFTO certification ($0 vs $2K/year)

---

### HEROES Detection = Behavioral Trust

**Already Designed** (see /policies/COOPERATION_SCORING.md):
- ✅ 6 behavior types (Helper, Educator, Reflector, Organizer, Engager, Supporter)
- ✅ Tier progression (Lurker → Participant → Helper → Trusted → Pillar → MVP)
- ✅ Governance weight (cooperation score = vote weight)

**Umbrella Application**:
- NGO staff earn cooperation scores (not just farmers)
- M&E specialist who helps 5 NGOs = Pillar tier (500+ points)
- Fundraiser who closes 10 grants = MVP tier (1000+ points)
- **Result**: Meritocratic governance (those who contribute most lead network)

---

- Policy influence (UNHCR adopts wizard as standard M&E tool)

---

## 🌟 The Equalizer Effect

### Why Umbrella Levels the Playing Field

**Before Umbrella** (Western NGO Advantage):
```
Western NGO:
- Brand recognition → donors trust → 40% grant approval
- Professional staff → polished reports → recurring funding
- Network access → corporate partnerships → B2B revenue

Refugee NGO:
- Unknown → donors skeptical → 10% grant approval
- Volunteer staff → basic reports → one-time funding
- No network → isolation → grant dependency
```

**After Umbrella** (Refugee NGO Advantage):
```
Refugee NGO + Wizard:
- Blockchain verification → instant trust → 60% grant approval
- Automated reporting → wizard-generated → recurring funding
- Umbrella network → B2B marketplace → commercial revenue
- BONUS: Lived experience → better solutions → higher impact

Result: Refugee NGO BEATS Western NGO (cryptographic proof > brand)
```

**The Shift**:
- From **reputation-based funding** (who you know) →
- To **verification-based funding** (what you prove)
- **Winners**: Unknown refugee NGOs with strong impact data
- **Losers**: Established NGOs with weak verification systems
