# Unidos Business Model Transformation 2026
## From Refugee-Led NGO to Self-Sustaining Fair-Chain Production Enterprise

**Created:** February 15, 2026
**Model Inspiration:** Bonzi_v5 HIVE DAO + Mondragon Cooperative + Fair Trade B2B
**Constitutional Principle:** Refugee-governed, data-transparent, profit-capped, mechanically sustainable

---

## The Product (One Sentence)

**5+ years of refugee-led regenerative agriculture expertise in Nakivale, productized into certified organic inputs (mushroom spawn, vermicompost, biochar) and fair-chain manufacturing, governed by refugee DAO and sold to developed-world B2B customers.**

---

## Part I: Current Reality vs. Target State

### Current Model (NGO Dependency)

```
UNHCR/Donor Grants
    │
    ▼
Unidos Programs (training, distribution)
    │
    ▼
Refugee Beneficiaries (free inputs, education)
    │
    ▼
Impact Reports → More Grants (cycle repeats)
```

**Problems:**
- Donor dependency (grant cycles, funding gaps)
- Free distribution model (not scalable)
- Impact measured in "people trained" not "revenue earned"
- Refugee agency limited (beneficiaries, not business owners)

### Target Model (Self-Sustaining B2B Enterprise)

```
Refugee Farmers (DAO members)
    │
    ▼
Production (mushroom spawn, vermicompost, biochar)
    │
    ▼
Quality Standards (DAO-governed, sealed measurement)
    │
    ▼
B2B Sales (developed-world fair-chain buyers)
    │
    ▼
Revenue → Treasury (DAO-controlled smart contract)
    │
    ▼
Distribution (profit-capped, contributor-weighted)
    │
    ▼
Reinvestment (equipment, expansion, R&D)
```

**Advantages:**
- Market validation (customers pay for value)
- Scalable (revenue funds growth)
- Refugee ownership (DAO governance)
- Fair compensation (contribution-weighted distribution)
- Impact multiplier (revenue + livelihood + agency)

## Part II: Bonzi_v5 Principles Applied to Unidos

### Principle 1: Data as Appreciating Collateral

**Bonzi model:**
> "7 years of manual community management expertise → irreplaceable dataset → trained oracle → competitive moat"

**Unidos adaptation:**
> "5+ years of regenerative agriculture implementation in refugee context → irreplaceable knowledge → certified production methods → competitive advantage"

**What Unidos Has (Irreplaceable):**

| Asset | Form | Value |
|-------|------|-------|
| **Nakivale soil data** | Before/after measurements (10cm/hr → 6.5cm/hr drainage) | Verifiable regeneration methodology |
| **Mushroom spawn multiplication** | Only lab in Nakivale, 4,800 kg production proven | Technical IP + market position |
| **Biochar production** | Locally-fabricated Kon-Tiki kilns, 6,100 kg/year | Scalable climate solution |
| **Women's health model** | 98% community demand validated, 90% knowledge improvement | Replicable social enterprise template |
| **Farmer training curriculum** | 501 farmers, 340 adopting practices | Proven education system |
| **Partnership network** | UNHCR, Re-Alliance, Mycorama, Afripads | Institutional credibility |

**This collateral appreciates** (like Bonzi's CM data):
- More production data → better quality standards → higher B2B prices
- More farmer training → larger production network → economies of scale
- More soil improvement → documented climate impact → carbon credit potential

---

### Principle 2: Flat-Fee Economics (Not Extraction)

**Bonzi model:**
> "$5-15 flat fee per transaction (not percentage) → revenue from COUNT not SIZE → aligned with community health"

**Unidos adaptation:**
> "Fair-trade fixed pricing (not market speculation) → revenue from VOLUME not PRICE → aligned with farmer sustainability"

**Pricing Structure:**

| Product | Production Cost | Fair Price (B2B) | Margin | Split |
|---------|----------------|------------------|--------|-------|
| **Mushroom Spawn (1kg)** | $2 (labor + substrate) | $8 | $6 | 70% farmer, 20% reinvest, 10% DAO |
| **Vermicompost (50kg bag)** | $5 (labor + feedstock) | $20 | $15 | 70% farmer, 20% reinvest, 10% DAO |
| **Biochar (100kg bag)** | $10 (labor + biomass) | $35 | $25 | 70% farmer, 20% reinvest, 10% DAO |
| **Dried Mushrooms (1kg)** | $3 (fresh + drying) | $15 | $12 | 70% farmer, 20% reinvest, 10% DAO |

**Why flat pricing works:**
- **Transparency:** Buyers know exact cost breakdown
- **Fairness:** Farmers earn consistent income (not speculative)
- **Scalability:** Volume growth = more farmer income (not price inflation)
- **Sustainability:** 20% reinvestment funds equipment, expansion

**Profit Cap:** No individual earns more than 3x median contributor income (Mondragon principle)

---

### Principle 3: Sealed Measurement + Quality Standards

**Bonzi model:**
> "CPI-253 scoring (sealed, anti-gaming) → contributors can't game what they can't see → trustworthy reputation"

**Unidos adaptation:**
> "Production Quality Index (PQI) → farmers can't fake what's independently verified → certified organic status"

**Production Quality Index (PQI) - 100 Point System:**

| Dimension | Weight | Measurement | Verification |
|-----------|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **Soil Health (D1-D2)** | 20 pts | Drainage rate, organic matter %, pH | Lab tests (quarterly) |
| **Production Volume (D3)** | 15 pts | kg output per hectare/batch | Weigh-ins (batch records) |
| **Input Circularity (D4)** | 15 pts | % waste recycled, closed-loop inputs | Waste audits (monthly) |
| **Quality Grade (D5)** | 20 pts | Product grading (A/B/C), contamination rate | 3rd-party inspection |
| **Training Participation (D6)** | 10 pts | Sessions attended, knowledge tests | Attendance logs |
| **Cooperation Score (D7)** | 10 pts | Peer assistance, knowledge sharing | Peer ratings |
| **Innovation (D8)** | 5 pts | New techniques tested, improvements suggested | Documentation review |
| **Sustainability (D9)** | 5 pts | Water usage, chemical-free production | Audit compliance |

**PQI Tiers (Member Progression):**
- **Apprentice (0-30 pts):** Learning phase, subsidized inputs, basic training
- **Producer (31-50 pts):** Full production member, standard pricing
- **Master Producer (51-70 pts):** Quality premium (+10%), can train others
- **Innovation Leader (71-85 pts):** R&D role, equipment access, +20% premium
- **Council Member (86-100 pts):** DAO governance role, strategic decisions

**Sealed Elements:**
- Exact PQI algorithm weights (prevent gaming)
- Lab testing methodology (third-party, random sampling)
- Peer rating system (anonymous, aggregate only)

**Transparent Elements:**
- Individual PQI score (visible to member)
- Tier status (publicly badged)
- Production volume (on-chain records)
- Payment distribution (smart contract transparent)

---

### Principle 4: DAO Governance (Refugee-Controlled)

**Bonzi model:**
> "Trust-weighted voting (not token-weighted) → cooperation score = vote weight → plutocracy impossible"

**Unidos adaptation:**
> "Production-weighted + seniority voting → PQI score + years active = vote weight → farmers control decisions"

**Voting Weight Formula:**
```
Vote Weight = (PQI Score × 0.6) + (Years Active × 10) + (Training Others × 5)

Example:
María: PQI 75, 3 years, trained 5 farmers
Weight = (75 × 0.6) + (3 × 10) + (5 × 5) = 45 + 30 + 25 = 100 votes

James: PQI 45, 1 year, trained 0 farmers
Weight = (45 × 0.6) + (1 × 10) + (0 × 5) = 27 + 10 + 0 = 37 votes
```

**DAO Decision Domains:**

| Domain | Requires | Quorum | Example Decisions |
|--------|----------|--------|------------------|
| **Treasury Allocation** | 66% approval | 40% members | Equipment purchases >$1,000 |
| **Quality Standards** | 75% approval | 50% members | New PQI dimensions, grading changes |
| **Member Sanctions** | 80% approval | 60% members | Remove member, slash rewards |
| **Pricing Changes** | 66% approval | 40% members | Adjust B2B pricing structure |
| **Partnership Approvals** | 51% approval | 30% members | New B2B customers, supply contracts |
| **Expansion Plans** | 66% approval | 40% members | New product lines, geographic expansion |

**DAO Infrastructure:**
- **Smart Contract Treasury:** Multi-sig on Polygon/Celo (low gas, accessible)
- **Voting Platform:** Snapshot (off-chain gas-free) or Aragon (on-chain)
- **Identity:** Government IDs + biometric verification (anti-Sybil in refugee context)
- **Proposals:** Any member >31 PQI can submit
- **Veto:** Founding team (Paulinho + core) can veto safety/legal issues (temporary, sunsets after 2 years)

**Mondragon Governance Principles Applied:**
- **One person, one vote base** (democratic foundation)
- **Plus** production-weighted bonus (meritocratic layer)
- **Profit cap:** No one earns >3x median (solidarity principle)
- **Education requirement:** All members get business/DAO training
- **Transparency:** All treasury movements public, decisions documented

## Part III: B2B Revenue Streams (Fair-Chain Supply)

### The Fair-Chain Value Proposition

**Traditional Supply Chain:**
```
African Producer → Middleman → Exporter → Importer → Distributor → Retailer → Customer
(Gets $1)         ($2)         ($3)        ($4)        ($5)          ($6)       (Pays $20)
```

**Unidos Fair-Chain Model:**
```
Refugee DAO → Quality Certification → Direct B2B Customer
(Gets $14)    ($1 certification)      (Pays $15, saves $5 vs. middlemen)
```

**Why B2B Customers Choose Fair-Chain:**
1. **ESG Compliance:** Refugee empowerment, climate impact (biochar carbon sequestration)
2. **Cost Savings:** No middlemen = lower prices than conventional supply
3. **Quality Assurance:** DAO-governed standards, third-party certified
4. **Story/Brand:** Transparent impact (refugee ownership, soil regeneration data)
5. **Stability:** Direct relationship reduces supply chain risk

## Part IV: Subsidy Strategy (Industrial Equipment)

### Total Equipment Needed: $74,000

**Category Breakdown:**

| Category | Amount | Subsidy Source | Timeline |
|----------|--------|----------------|----------|
| **Mushroom Processing** | $31,000 | EU Agri-Food Partnerships, USAID Feed the Future | Q1 2026 |
| **Biochar Production** | $29,000 | Climate Finance (Green Climate Fund, Stripe Climate) | Q2 2026 |
| **Women's Circle Production** | $14,000 | UN Women, Gates Foundation (gender equity) | Q3 2026 |
| **Total** | **$74,000** | | |

### Subsidy Application Strategy

#### Option A: EU Humanitarian Aid + Development (EuropeAid)
- **Focus:** Refugee economic integration, sustainable livelihoods
- **Ask:** $50,000 (covers mushroom + biochar equipment)
- **Timeline:** 3-6 months application → 12 months implementation
- **Match requirement:** 10-20% (raise via crowdfunding or angel donors)

#### Option B: Climate Finance Vertical (Green Climate Fund)
- **Focus:** Biochar carbon sequestration, soil health, climate adaptation
- **Ask:** $30,000 (biochar kilns, carbon verification systems)
- **Timeline:** 6-9 months (longer but higher success rate for climate projects)
- **Match requirement:** None for adaptation projects in LDCs (Uganda qualifies)

#### Option C: Corporate ESG Partnerships
- **Target:** Companies needing carbon offsets + supply chain impact stories
- **Ask:** $25,000-50,000 as "impact investment" (equipment loan, forgivable if targets met)
- **Candidates:** Microsoft Climate Innovation Fund, Patagonia Venture Fund, Stripe Climate
- **Timeline:** 2-4 months (faster, more flexible)
- **Terms:** Equity-free, tied to carbon credit purchase agreement

#### Option D: Blended Approach (Recommended)
- **EU/UNHCR grant:** $30,000 (40%)
- **Climate finance:** $25,000 (34%)
- **Corporate ESG:** $15,000 (20%)
- **Crowdfunding/Angels:** $4,000 (6%)
- **Total:** $74,000 secured across 12-18 months

### Subsidy Justification (Grant Application Framing)

**Problem Statement:**
> Nakivale Refugee Settlement hosts 170,000+ refugees, with 30% sanitation coverage, 7L water/household/day, and dependence on declining humanitarian aid. Climate variability and soil degradation threaten food security for both refugees and host communities.

**Solution (Unidos Model):**
> Refugee-led production enterprise transforming agricultural waste into high-value organic inputs (mushroom spawn, vermicompost, biochar), creating livelihood pathways while sequestering carbon and regenerating degraded soil. DAO governance ensures transparent, equitable distribution of profits to 100+ refugee farmers.

**Equipment Subsidy Need:**
> Current manual production (6 tons biochar/year, 8 tons vermicompost/year, 4.8 tons mushrooms/year) cannot meet B2B market demand. Industrial equipment ($74,000) enables scale to 40 tons biochar, 50 tons vermicompost, 15 tons mushrooms annually—enough to generate $364,000 revenue and provide sustainable income to 100 refugee families.

**Impact Metrics:**
- **Economic:** 100 refugee families earning 3-5x current income
- **Environmental:** 150 tons CO2e sequestered/avoided annually
- **Social:** 500 women accessing menstrual health resources, 500 farmers trained
- **Replication:** Model licensed to 10+ refugee settlements globally

**Return on Investment (for funders):**
- **Subsidy:** $74,000 (one-time)
- **Self-sustaining revenue:** $364,000/year (recurring)
- **Break-even:** Year 1 (equipment paid for by operations)
- **5-year impact:** $1.8M cumulative revenue, 500 families lifted out of poverty
- **Replication multiplier:** 10 settlements adopt model = 5,000 families impacted

---

## Part V: DAO Governance Structure (Technical Implementation)

### Smart Contract Treasury Architecture

**Chain:** Polygon (low gas, widely adopted) or Celo (mobile-first, refugee-friendly)

**Contracts:**

#### 1. UnidosTreasury.sol
```solidity
// Multi-sig treasury with DAO voting integration
// Functions:
- receivePayment(source, amount) → log B2B payments
- distributeToProducers(epoch) → 70% split by PQI weight
- allocateReinvestment(proposal_id) → 20% for equipment/expansion
- allocateSolidarityFund(emergency_id) → 10% for community needs
```

#### 2. ProductionQualityIndex.sol (PQI)
```solidity
// On-chain reputation for producers
// Functions:
- recordProduction(member, kg, quality_grade) → update PQI score
- recordTraining(member, sessions) → update PQI score
- recordPeerRating(rater, rated, score) → update cooperation dimension
- calculateVotingWeight(member) → return vote weight for governance
```

#### 3. UnidosGovernance.sol (Snapshot integration or Aragon)
```solidity
// Proposal + voting system
// Functions:
- createProposal(title, description, amount, category) → requires PQI >31
- vote(proposal_id, support) → weight = PQI + seniority
- executeProposal(proposal_id) → requires quorum + approval threshold
- vetoProposal(proposal_id) → founding team only (sunsets after 2 years)
```

#### 4. CertificationNFT.sol
```solidity
// Soulbound NFTs for certifications
// Functions:
- mintCertification(member, cert_type, expiry) → Organic, Fair Trade, PQI tier
- verifyCertification(member, cert_type) → B2B customers can verify on-chain
- revokeCertification(member, cert_type) → if standards violated
```

### DAO Membership Tiers (On-Chain Badges)

| Tier | PQI Range | Rights | On-Chain Badge |
|------|-----------|--------|----------------|
| **Apprentice** | 0-30 | Attend meetings, receive training | Bronze NFT (non-transferable) |
| **Producer** | 31-50 | Vote on operational proposals, earn standard rate | Silver NFT |
| **Master** | 51-70 | Vote on all proposals, train others, +10% premium | Gold NFT |
| **Innovation Leader** | 71-85 | Propose new products, R&D access, +20% premium | Platinum NFT |
| **Council** | 86-100 | Strategic decisions, treasury oversight, represent DAO | Diamond NFT |

### Voting Mechanics (Snapshot + On-Chain Hybrid)

**Off-Chain (Snapshot):**
- Gasless voting (important for low-income members)
- Weekly operational decisions (small budget allocations)
- Signal votes (temperature checks)

**On-Chain (Polygon/Celo):**
- Treasury withdrawals >$1,000
- Member sanctions (removal, reward slashing)
- Constitution amendments (voting weight formula, profit split)

**Quorum Rules:**
- Operational (< $1,000): 30% turnout required
- Treasury (> $1,000): 40% turnout required
- Constitutional: 60% turnout required

### Human-in-the-Loop Safeguards

**Bonzi lesson applied:** "DAO + AI hybrid, not pure automation"

**Human Decision Points:**

1. **Conflict Resolution:** When PQI scoring is disputed → Arbitration Council (5 elected Master+ members, rotates quarterly)

2. **Emergency Override:** If treasury funds at risk (hack, bug, legal issue) → Founding team + 2 Council members can freeze (temporary, must go to full DAO vote within 7 days)

3. **Quality Disputes:** If B2B customer rejects shipment → Quality Committee (3 Master Producers + 1 third-party inspector) investigates

4. **New Member Vetting:** First 6 months probation → existing members vote to confirm (prevent Sybil attacks in refugee context where identity fraud exists)

### Privacy + Transparency Balance

**Public (On-Chain):**
- Total treasury balance
- Proposal voting results
- PQI tier (not exact score)
- Production volume totals
- Certification status

**Private (Off-Chain, Encrypted):**
- Exact PQI algorithm weights (anti-gaming)
- Individual earnings (privacy)
- Personal identity data (refugee protection)
- Lab test results (until aggregated)
- Customer contracts (commercial confidentiality)

**Quarterly Public Reports:**
- Total revenue, expenses, distribution
- Number of active members per tier
- Production volumes by product
- Carbon sequestration totals
- New certifications achieved

- **EU Organic Equivalent (Uganda certification body):** $2,000/year
- **Fairtrade International:** $3,000/year, 9-month process

**Expected Phase 2 Revenue:** $100,000-150,000 (larger orders, certified status)

### Phase 3: Corporate ESG Programs (Months 12-24)

**Target:** Companies buying carbon offsets + seeking impact supply chains

| Customer Type | Entry Point | Value Proposition | Contract Size |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Microsoft Climate Innovation** | Carbon removal portfolio | Biochar sequestration + refugee impact story | $50,000/year |
| **Stripe Climate** | Emerging tech buyers | Verifiable carbon credits, blockchain-tracked | $25,000/year |
| **Patagonia** | Supply chain sustainability | Organic inputs for regenerative cotton farms | $40,000/year |

| **Unilever Sustainable Sourcing** | Smallholder programs | Mushroom nutrition for developing markets | $60,000/year |

**Pitch Angle:** "Refugee-led carbon removal + livelihood creation = dual ESG impact"

**Verification Needed:**
- **Carbon credits:** Gold Standard or Verra certification ($10,000-15,000 one-time)
- **Impact reporting:** Quarterly metrics (jobs created, income levels, carbon sequestered)
- **Blockchain tracking:** Polygon NFTs for each batch (provenance + carbon accounting)

**Expected Phase 3 Revenue:** $200,000+ (corporate contracts larger, longer-term)

---

## Part VII: Risks + Mitigation

### Risk 1: Quality Inconsistency (Production Scaling)

**Risk:** Manual production works at small scale, but B2B customers reject shipments if quality drops

**Mitigation:**
- **PQI sealed measurement:** Continuous quality monitoring, not just final inspection
- **Third-party testing:** Monthly lab tests (soil analysis, contamination checks)
- **Batch tracking:** Blockchain NFTs tie each shipment to producer + production date
- **Quality premium:** Master Producers earn more, incentivizing consistency
- **Rejection insurance:** 20% reinvestment fund includes buffer for rejected batches

### Risk 2: DAO Governance Failure (Low Participation, Plutocracy)

**Risk:** Members don't vote, or high-PQI members dominate decisions unfairly

**Mitigation:**
- **Seniority weighting:** Years active + training others balances PQI dominance
- **Quorum requirements:** Decisions void if <40% participation
- **Quadratic voting (optional):** For high-stakes decisions, use quadratic formula (cost = votes²)
- **Offline voting:** Not everyone has smartphone—paper ballots counted by trusted counters
- **Education requirement:** DAO literacy training mandatory for all members
- **Human override:** Arbitration Council for disputes, founding team temporary veto (sunsets)

### Risk 3: Donor/Grant Dependency Doesn't End

**Risk:** Revenue from B2B doesn't materialize, DAO still relies on grants

**Mitigation:**
- **Phased transition:** Year 1 = 70% grants, 30% revenue → Year 3 = 30% grants, 70% revenue
- **Milestone gates:** Equipment subsidy tied to hitting revenue targets (accountability)
- **Diversified revenue:** 4 streams (mushrooms, soil, training, women's circle) reduce single-product risk
- **Market validation first:** Pilot B2B contracts before full transition from NGO model
- **Fallback:** If B2B fails, continue NGO model but with DAO governance (still better than status quo)

### Risk 4: Refugee Legal Status Limits Business Operations

**Risk:** Refugees in Uganda can work, but export regulations or business registration complex

**Mitigation:**
- **Legal structure:** Register Unidos as Ugandan cooperative (not foreign entity)
- **Host community integration:** 30% of DAO members = local Ugandans (builds political support)
- **Government partnership:** Work with Uganda Investment Authority (refugee entrepreneurship initiative)
- **UNHCR advocacy:** Leverage Gene Dewey Award, existing relationships to navigate legal
- **Precedent:** Opportunity Bank operates in Nakivale (banking for refugees legal) → business also possible

### Risk 5: Climate Shocks (Drought, Floods) Disrupt Production

**Risk:** 2025 drought reduced biochar biomass availability, future climate events could halt production

**Mitigation:**
- **Diversified inputs:** Biochar uses multiple biomass types (maize, other crops, wood waste)
- **Mushroom indoor production:** Less climate-dependent than field crops
- **Solidarity fund (10%):** Emergency buffer for climate shocks
- **Insurance (explore):** Index-based weather insurance for agriculture (Uganda pilots exist)
- **Water infrastructure:** If 2025 water plant completes, drought risk reduces

### Risk 6: B2B Customers Don't Pay or Cancel Contracts

**Risk:** Refugee-led enterprise has less negotiating power, payment delays or cancellations hurt

**Mitigation:**
- **Payment terms:** 50% upfront, 50% on delivery (standard fair trade terms)
- **Diversified customer base:** Not dependent on 1-2 big customers
- **Escrow smart contracts:** Payment locked in contract, released on delivery proof (blockchain)
- **Legal support:** Partner with fair trade legal organizations (pro bono contract review)
- **Reputation leverage:** Public commitments from ESG customers hard to break (reputational risk)

## Part X: Why This Model Works (Theory of Change)

### The Bonzi DAO Lesson Applied

**Bonzi insight:**
> "7 years of manual work → digitized into oracle → permissionless talent pipeline → fair payment through flat fees → self-sustaining economy"

**Unidos adaptation:**
> "5 years of regenerative agriculture → productized into certified inputs → refugee-governed production → fair-chain B2B sales → self-sustaining livelihoods"

**Parallels:**

| Bonzi Model | Unidos Adaptation |
|-------------|-------------------|
| **CM expertise (7 years)** | **Regenerative ag expertise (5 years)** |
| **CPI-253 scoring** | **PQI-100 scoring** |
| **Sealed measurement (anti-gaming)** | **Third-party certification (quality assurance)** |
| **Euler pool (trading fees → contributors)** | **DAO treasury (B2B revenue → farmers)** |
| **Trust-weighted voting** | **Production-weighted voting** |
| **Flat fees ($5-15/tx)** | **Fair-trade pricing (fixed, transparent)** |
| **Permissionless talent pipeline** | **Open farmer membership (PQI-gated progression)** |
| **Data as collateral (appreciates)** | **Soil data + methods as IP (appreciates)** |
| **Self-funding (trading volume)** | **Self-funding (production volume)** |

### The Fair-Chain Innovation

**Traditional Fair Trade Problem:**
- Certification expensive ($3,000-5,000/year)
- Relies on consumer goodwill ("pay more for ethics")
- Middlemen still extract margins (just "fairer" margins)
- Producers remain price-takers, not price-makers

**Unidos Fair-Chain Solution:**
- **DAO governance = transparency built-in** (no need to trust certifier, see on-chain)
- **B2B customers save money** (no middlemen) while getting ESG impact
- **Producers set prices** (DAO votes on pricing, not buyer dictates)
- **Blockchain provenance** (NFT tracks each batch from farmer to buyer)
- **Carbon credits add revenue stream** (not just product sales)

**Why B2B customers prefer this:**
1. **Cost:** Save 20-30% vs conventional supply (no middlemen)
2. **ESG:** Refugee empowerment + carbon sequestration (dual impact)
3. **Story:** Transparent DAO governance, real-time metrics (marketing gold)
4. **Quality:** PQI scoring + third-party testing (better than commodity)
5. **Stability:** Direct relationship, long-term contracts (supply security)

### The Refugee Agency Transformation

**Current NGO model:**
```
Refugee = Beneficiary (passive)
    → Receives free inputs, training
    → No ownership, no decision power
    → Dependency persists
```

**DAO business model:**
```
Refugee = Owner (active)
    → Earns from production (labor + capital returns)
    → Votes on strategy, pricing, expansion
    → Builds assets (PQI reputation, DAO treasury share)
    → Self-determination achieved
```

**Psychological + Political Impact:**
- **Dignity:** Earning income > receiving charity
- **Skills:** Business governance > just farming skills
- **Voice:** DAO voting = political participation practice
- **Mobility:** PQI score + income = pathway out of settlement (if desired)
- **Replication:** Model proves refugees = entrepreneurs (policy influence)

---

## Conclusion: The 3-Year Vision

### Year 1 (2026): Foundation + Proof
- DAO governance operational (100 members)
- $100,000 revenue (30% B2B, 70% grants)
- Equipment subsidies secured ($74k)
- First certifications achieved (organic, fair trade)
- Pilot B2B contracts prove market demand

### Year 2 (2027): Scale + Sustainability
- $364,000 revenue (70% B2B, 30% grants)
- 100 refugee families earning 3-5x average income
- Carbon credits generating supplemental revenue
- Model licensed to 3+ other settlements
- Fully self-sustaining operations (grants = expansion only)

### Year 3 (2028): Expansion + Replication
- $750,000 revenue (85% B2B, 15% grants for R&D)
- 250 DAO members across multiple product lines
- 10 settlements using Unidos model (franchise/license)
- Corporate ESG partnerships established (multi-year contracts)
- Policy influence (Uganda government, UNHCR - refugee entrepreneurship)

### The Endgame: Institutional Completeness (5+ years)

Following Mondragon/Bonzi model:

| Institution | Unidos Implementation | Timeline |
|-------------|----------------------|----------|
| **Internal Bank** | Cooperative credit union (members save + borrow) | Year 4-5 |
| **Education System** | Nakivale Agricultural University (training hub) | Year 5-6 |
| **R&D Division** | Innovation lab (new products, climate tech) | Year 3-4 |
| **Insurance Cooperative** | Weather index insurance, health coverage | Year 4-5 |
| **Housing Cooperative** | Affordable housing for members (land acquisition) | Year 5-7 |
| **Food Cooperative** | Member food security guaranteed | Year 2-3 |

**The Vision:**
> "A refugee who joins Unidos as an Apprentice can progress to Council Member, earn sustainable income, access credit for a home, send children to cooperative school, receive healthcare through cooperative insurance, and retire with savings in the cooperative bank. They transition from beneficiary to owner, from dependent to self-determined."

**This is not fantasy. This is the Mondragon model, proven over 70 years. Unidos applies it to refugees.**

**What Competitors Have (And How Unidos Differs):**

| Competitor | What They Do | Unidos Difference |
|------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Rwamwanja Rural Foundation** | Permaculture + mushrooms (Rwamwanja settlement) | Similar model, different settlement—partnership opportunity, not threat |
| **PIFP (Swiss Contact Kyangwali)** | Large mushroom program (2,300 participants) | Institutional (NGO-led), Unidos is refugee-owned (DAO-governed) |
| **Kakuma Farm Cooperative** | 900 farmers, $23k profits (Kenya) | Government land (not replicable), Unidos model = individual plots + DAO |
| **Go-Green (Elijah, Nakivale)** | Mushroom cultivation in Nakivale | Smaller scale, individual-led—potential collaborator or spawn customer |
| **KBTN (Nakivale)** | Seed bank, community gardens | Complementary (their seeds + Unidos compost) |

**Strategic Positioning:**
- **Don't compete with large institutional programs** (PIFP, Kakuma)—different model
- **Partner with complementary Nakivale orgs** (KBTN, Go-Green, YICE)
- **Differentiate on governance** (DAO-owned vs NGO-managed)
- **Lead on integration** (most orgs siloed, Unidos connects programs)
- **Export the model** (license to other settlements, revenue stream)
