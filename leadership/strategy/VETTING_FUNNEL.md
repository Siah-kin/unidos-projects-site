# Unidos Vetting Funnel — Pan-African NGO Incubation

**Date**: February 2026
**Purpose**: Document vetting system to incubate legitimate refugee-led startups across Africa while preventing fraud common with NGO funding

**Target**: Help projects achieve $500/month self-sustainability (covers 1-2 staff + materials + transport)

---

## 🎯 The Fraud Problem

### Why African NGOs Face Trust Deficit

**Common Scams**:
1. **Ghost projects** — Photos/testimonials stolen from other organizations
2. **Inflated metrics** — "Trained 500 farmers" but only 20 exist
3. **Fund diversion** — Grant money for equipment → spent on personal use
4. **Duplicate funding** — Same project pitched to 5 funders, all think they're sole supporter
5. **Zombie NGOs** — Registration exists, no actual operations

**Result**: Donors skeptical of ALL African NGOs (legitimate projects suffer)

**Example from Unidos Experience**:
- Struggled to get fundraising support ("how do we know you're real?")
- Western NGOs favored despite weaker outcomes (brand recognition > actual impact)
- Had to prove legitimacy repeatedly (exhausting, slows growth)

## 💡 The Solution: Cryptographic Vetting + Earned Credibility

### Core Principle

**Unidos cannot vet others until it proves itself first.**

**3-Phase Credibility Building**:

#### **Phase 1: Prove Unidos (Year 1-2)**
- Cryptographic verification of OWN projects (mushroom, vermicompost, biochar, Women's Circle)
- HEROES cooperation scoring (501 farmers tracked behaviorally)
- PQI production quality (batch-level Merkle proofs)
- On-chain treasury (transparent financial flows)
- **Outcome**: Unidos = verified benchmark (donors trust Unidos verification system)

#### **Phase 2: Pilot Vetting (Year 2-3)**
- Vet 2-3 partner NGOs (RRF, SINA, or equivalent)
- Document lessons learned (what signals fraud vs legitimacy?)
- Refine vetting score system (iterate based on pilot failures/successes)
- **Outcome**: Vetting methodology validated (donors trust Unidos can vet others)

#### **Phase 3: Scale Vetting (Year 3+)**
- Open umbrella network to applications (10-20 NGOs/year)
- Graduated acceptance (higher vetting thresholds as network grows)
- Reputation staking (existing NGOs vouch for new applicants)
- **Outcome**: Unidos = trusted gatekeeper (donors fund ANY Unidos-vetted project)

## 🔍 Vetting Funnel Mechanics

### Stage 1: Application (Week 1)

**Basic Eligibility Criteria** (Auto-reject if fails):
- [ ] Refugee-led or refugee-serving (51%+ leadership from displaced communities)
- [ ] Registered NGO/CBO (legal entity, tax-exempt status)
- [ ] Operational 6+ months (not brand new, some track record)
- [ ] Regenerative focus (agriculture, renewable energy, circular economy, education)
- [ ] Committed to transparency (willing to share financial data, beneficiary contacts)

**Application Form** (10 questions, 20 minutes):
1. Organization name, location, registration details
2. Founder story (why started, personal connection to problem)
3. Current beneficiaries (number served, demographics, verification contacts)
4. Revenue sources (grants, sales, donations — breakdown by %)
5. Financial transparency (willing to connect bank account, show treasury?)
6. Product/service description (what do you produce/provide?)
7. Sustainability plan (how reach $500/month within 12 months?)
8. References (2-3 verifiable contacts: funders, partners, beneficiaries)
9. Social media presence (Facebook, Instagram, X/Twitter — activity check)
10. Why join Unidos umbrella? (what support needed, what can contribute)

**Auto-scoring** (AI flags):
- Generic language (ChatGPT fingerprints → red flag)
- Copy-paste from other orgs (plagiarism check → reject)
- Unrealistic metrics ("trained 10,000 farmers in 6 months" → fraud signal)
- No social media activity (ghost org → investigate)

---

### Stage 2: Reference Verification (Week 2)

**Automated Checks**:
1. **NGO registration lookup** (verify legal entity exists)
2. **Social media activity** (3+ months active posting, real engagement)
3. **Google Maps presence** (physical address, photos, reviews if applicable)
4. **Domain verification** (website SSL, creation date >6 months ago)

**Manual Outreach** (Unidos staff contacts):
1. **References** (call/email 2-3 contacts listed in application)
   - Confirm relationship (did they actually fund/partner with this NGO?)
   - Ask for honest assessment (strengths, weaknesses, red flags?)
2. **Beneficiaries** (random sample, 3-5 people)
   - Confirm received services ("Did you attend training? When? What learned?")
   - Ask about quality ("Was it helpful? Would recommend to others?")
3. **Local government** (OPM, district officials if refugee settlement)
   - Confirm presence ("Is this NGO active in your area? Any issues?")

**Red Flags** (Reject if 2+):
- References don't respond or deny relationship
- Beneficiaries never heard of organization
- Local officials report complaints/fraud history
- Financial records don't match claimed revenue
- Social media engagement is fake (bots, purchased followers)

---

### Stage 3: Pilot Test (Month 1-3)

**"Prove It" Challenge** (Low-stakes trial):

**Task**: Use wizard to run ONE crowdfunding campaign
- Goal: Raise $500-$2,000 (achievable for legitimate org)
- Duration: 30 days
- Milestones: 3-4 deliverables (must provide photo/video evidence)
- Escrow: Funds held until milestones verified

**What We're Testing**:
1. **Can they deliver?** (complete milestones on time, quality acceptable?)
2. **Are beneficiaries real?** (HEROES detection via Telegram community, behavioral patterns)
3. **Is data truthful?** (cross-reference claims with on-ground verification)
4. **Do they engage authentically?** (respond to questions, transparent about challenges?)

**Pilot Outcomes**:
- ✅ **Pass** (80%+ milestones completed, beneficiaries verified, engagement authentic) → Advance to Stage 4
- ⚠️ **Conditional** (60-79% completion, minor issues) → Coaching + retry once
- ❌ **Fail** (<60% completion, fraud signals detected) → Reject + ban from reapplying 12 months

---

### Stage 4: Full Onboarding (Month 4-6)

**Wizard Access Granted**:
- Tier: **Starter** ($25/mo, waived for first 6 months if pilot passed)
- Features: HEROES detection, PQI scoring, 3 campaigns/year
- Support: Weekly check-ins (Unidos mentor assigned)
- Training: M&E workshop (impact measurement, data collection)

**Vetting Score Assignment** (100-point system):

| Dimension | Weight | Scoring Criteria |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| **Financial Transparency** | 20 pts | Bank account connected (10 pts) + Monthly reports (5 pts) + On-chain treasury opt-in (5 pts) |
| **Output Delivered** | 30 pts | Pilot milestones completed (30 pts), partial credit for % completion |
| **Beneficiary Impact** | 25 pts | Beneficiaries verified (10 pts) + Behavioral engagement (10 pts) + Testimonial quality (5 pts) |
| **Sustainability** | 15 pts | Revenue >$200/mo (5 pts) + Pathway to $500/mo (5 pts) + Commercial viability (5 pts) |
| **Quality** | 10 pts | PQI score avg >75 (10 pts), proportional for lower scores |

**Interpretation**:
- **85-100**: Premium tier (eligible for larger grants, featured in donor network)
- **70-84**: Standard tier (full wizard access, standard support)
- **60-69**: Probationary (6-month review, coaching required)
- **<60**: Rejected (refund Starter fee if paid, exit umbrella network)

---

### Stage 5: Ongoing Monitoring (Month 7+)

**Quarterly Reviews**:
- Vetting score recalculated (based on 3-month data)
- Beneficiary spot checks (random sample verification)
- Financial audit (compare reported vs actual revenue)
- Community feedback (other umbrella NGOs flag concerns?)

**Tier Progression**:
- **Up**: 70 → 85 (unlock Premium benefits, higher grant access)
- **Maintain**: Stay in tier (continue current support level)
- **Down**: 85 → 70 (warning issued, coaching offered)
- **Exit**: <60 for 2 consecutive quarters (removed from network)

## 🛡️ Fraud Prevention Layers

### Layer 1: Cryptographic Verification (Can't Fake)

**On-Chain Data**:
- Treasury wallet (all funds flow visible on blockchain explorer)
- Merkle proofs (batch-level production data, cryptographically verifiable)
- Timestamp anchors (photos/videos hashed, immutable record of "when")

**Impossibility of Fraud**:
- Can't claim "trained 500 farmers" if only 50 wallet addresses exist
- Can't inflate revenue if on-chain treasury shows actual flows
- Can't backdate evidence if timestamp anchors prove creation date

---

### Layer 2: HEROES Behavioral Detection (AI Catches Patterns)

**Fraud Signals AI Detects**:
1. **Copy-paste responses** (generic "thank you" messages, no personalization)
2. **Burst activity** (silent for weeks, then 100 messages in 1 day → gaming score)
3. **Ring behavior** (5 accounts always like/comment together → collusion)
4. **ChatGPT fingerprints** ("I'm thrilled to share", "transformative impact" → AI-generated)
5. **Ghost beneficiaries** (account created yesterday, no activity except voting → fake)

**HEROES Legitimacy Signals**:
- Consistent engagement (daily/weekly activity, not bursts)
- Authentic language (typos, local dialect, personal stories)
- Spontaneous questions (asking for help, not just self-promotion)
- Cross-validation (other community members confirm relationship)

---

### Layer 3: EigenTrust Reputation Graph (Ring Detection)

**How It Works**:
- Every NGO in network rates others (trustworthy or suspicious)
- Algorithm detects collusion rings (Group A always rates each other 5/5, outsiders 1/5)
- Isolated nodes flagged (no one vouches for them → potential fraud)

**Example**:
```
Unidos → trusts RRF (80%) → trusts SINA (75%)
SINA → trusts Unidos (85%) → trusts NewNGO (40%)
NewNGO → trusts self-created accounts (100%) ← RED FLAG
```

**Action**: NewNGO flagged for investigation (likely fraud ring)

---

### Layer 4: Passport Gate (Identity Verification)

**Multi-Factor Human Verification**:
1. **ERC-8004 passport** (on-chain identity, Sybil resistance)
2. **Telegram verified account** (phone number linked)
3. **X/Twitter account** (3+ months old, >50 followers, organic activity)
4. **Video call** (Unidos mentor meets founder, confirms real human)

**Anti-Sybil**:
- One person can't create 100 fake NGOs (biometric tie to identity)
- Stolen identities caught (cross-reference with government IDs if suspicious)

---

### Layer 5: Graduated Sanctions (Ostrom Model)

**Violation Tiers**:

| Violation | First Offense | Second Offense | Third Offense |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Minor** (late milestone, incomplete data) | Warning email | Coaching required | Vetting score -5 pts |
| **Moderate** (exaggerated metrics, poor quality) | Vetting score -10 pts | Probation (6 months) | Suspended (12 months) |
| **Severe** (ghost beneficiaries, fund diversion) | Suspended (12 months) | Banned (permanent) | Reported to authorities |

**Appeal Process**:
- NGO can contest suspension (submit evidence to dispute claim)
- Peer review (3 random umbrella NGOs vote on appeal)
- Majority vote overturns → reinstate, otherwise ban upheld

---

## 💰 $500/Month Sustainability Threshold

### Why $500/Month?

**Covers Basic Operations** (Refugee settlement context):
- 1-2 staff salaries: $200-$300/month (local wages)
- Materials/supplies: $100-$150/month (seeds, tools, packaging)
- Transport: $50-$100/month (tricycle, motorcycle fuel)
- Communications: $20/month (airtime, internet)
- Buffer: $30-$50/month (emergencies, unexpected costs)

**Market Validation**:
- If clients/beneficiaries won't pay $500/month value → not solving real problem
- If can't reach $500/month in 12 months → model not viable

**Self-Sustainability**:
- No perpetual grant dependency (can survive without external funding)
- Reinvestment possible ($100-$200/month back into operations)
- Growth trajectory (Year 2: $1K/month, Year 3: $2K/month, etc.)

---

### Revenue Pathways to $500/Month

**Option 1: B2B Product Sales** (Unidos model)
- Mushroom spawn: 10 clients × $50/month = $500
- Vermicompost: 5 farms × $100/month = $500
- Biochar: 20 sacks × $25/sack = $500

**Option 2: Training as Service**
- Permaculture workshops: 2 trainings/month × $250 = $500
- M&E consulting: 1 NGO client × $500/month = $500

**Option 3: Artisan Products**
- Handmade baskets: 50 units × $10 = $500
- Organic soap: 200 bars × $2.50 = $500
- Textiles: 10 pieces × $50 = $500

**Option 4: Hybrid Model** (Most Common)
- B2B sales: $200/month
- Training fees: $150/month
- Crowdfunding tips: $100/month
- Grant co-funding: $50/month (stable donor, small recurring)
- **Total**: $500/month

## 📊 Vetting Funnel Conversion Rates

### Expected Flow (100 Applications → 10 Graduates)

| Stage | Applicants | Pass Rate | Graduates | Why Fail |
|-------|-----------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **Stage 1: Application** | 100 | 50% | 50 | Auto-reject (ghost orgs, fake data, ChatGPT applications) |
| **Stage 2: Verification** | 50 | 60% | 30 | References don't confirm, beneficiaries not real, local officials flag issues |
| **Stage 3: Pilot Test** | 30 | 70% | 21 | Can't deliver milestones, low engagement, quality issues |
| **Stage 4: Onboarding** | 21 | 90% | 19 | Vetting score <60, transparency issues |
| **Stage 5: 12-Month Review** | 19 | 53% | **10** | Can't reach $500/month, quality declined, fraud detected later |

**Final Success Rate**: 10/100 (10%)

**Why So Selective?**
- Protects Unidos reputation (1 fraud scandal ruins entire network)
- Ensures donor trust (if Unidos vets = donors confident)
- Focuses resources (better to deeply support 10 legit NGOs than shallowly support 100 questionable ones)

- Tech community validates (IEEE DAO guidelines reference SIAH as case study)

---

### Year 2-3: Pilot Vetting

**Actions**:
- [ ] Vet 2-3 partner NGOs (RRF mushroom focus, SINA entrepreneurship, one new applicant)
- [ ] Document vetting process (what worked, what failed, lessons learned)
- [ ] Publish case studies (transparent reporting: "We vetted 5, passed 2, rejected 3 — here's why")
- [ ] Iterate methodology (refine fraud detection based on pilot failures)

**Outcome**: Vetting methodology validated
- Donors trust Unidos can vet others (not just self-verification)
- Rejected NGOs understand why (transparent criteria, appeal process)
- Partner NGOs succeed (reach $500/month, prove model works)

---

### Year 3+: Scale Vetting

**Actions**:
- [ ] Open applications (10-20 NGOs/year, rigorous selection)
- [ ] Reputation staking (existing NGOs vouch for new applicants, lose points if fraud)
- [ ] Donor network launch (funders can browse vetted NGOs, invest directly)
- [ ] Policy influence (UNHCR, FAO adopt vetting standards for refugee entrepreneurship)

**Outcome**: Unidos = trusted gatekeeper
- Donors fund ANY Unidos-vetted project (no due diligence needed, trust delegated)
- NGOs compete to join umbrella (vetting badge = funding access)
- Fraud rate <5% (anti-gaming layers work, network self-polices)
