---

### 2. Key Innovation Highlights (For Landing Page)

**Tagline**: "First model where refugees farm transaction fees by contributing behavioral data"

**Three-Sentence Summary**:
> Refugees in Uganda earn $3.50-6.50/month by contributing behavioral data (cooperation patterns, agricultural knowledge, carbon verification). Unidos Projects, a multi-award-winning NGO, ethically monetizes anonymized datasets, using revenue to purchase Ethereum as reserve currency backing internal barter tokens at 150% overcollateralization. This creates KYC-free financial access with zero out-of-pocket costs, enabling 82% excluded refugees to access banking, microloans, and remittances.

**Impact Metrics** (For Visuals):
- **180x cost coverage**: $3.50 data value covers $0.02 blockchain fees per month
- **82% → 0% exclusion**: From 82% unbanked to 100% KYC-free access
- **90% cash-out avoidance**: Internal barter economy keeps value circulating
- **$4.8M/year potential**: If scaled to 100,000 refugees by 2030

---

### 3. Oracle 6 Categorization

**Primary Oracle**: **Innovator** (novel breakthrough: data-as-collateral backing for community currency)

**Secondary Oracles**:
- **Strategist**: Long-term vision (100,000 refugees by 2030, policy change at UNHCR/Central Bank)
- **Analyst**: Financial modeling (revenue projections, collateral ratios, cost-benefit analysis)
- **Guardian**: Ethics (data sovereignty, anonymization, informed consent)
- **Connector**: Partnerships (CGIAR agriculture research, Microsoft Climate carbon buyers)

**Wizard Flow Integration**:
- "Setup Data Farming" wizard (guide refugees through consent, contribution, token earning)
- "Internal Marketplace" wizard (browse goods/services purchasable with UNIDOS tokens)
- "Cash-Out" wizard (convert UNIDOS → UGX for external bills, 2% fee)

---

### 4. Technical Specifications (For Bonzi_v5 Implementation)

**Smart Contracts Referenced**:
1. `DataContribution.sol` (Celo): Track user data contributions, assign USD value
2. `BarterToken.sol` (Celo): ERC-20 token (UNIDOS symbol), 150% overcollateralized
3. `CollateralVault` (Ethereum Mainnet): Gnosis Safe multi-sig holding ETH reserve

**Integration Points**:
- **SIAH Protocol**: HEROES behavioral detection feeds `DataContribution.sol` (auto-assign data value to Helper, Educator, Organizer behaviors)
- **Euler Pool**: UNIDOS token distributions use same O(1) gas mechanism (batch mint to 500+ wallets)
- **Snapshot Voting**: Cooperation score (from HEROES) = voting weight in DAO governance

**Multi-Chain Architecture**:
- **Celo**: Primary (phone number wallets, USSD support, $0.001 fees)
- **Base**: Fiat on-ramps (Coinbase integration, diaspora remittances)
- **Ethereum Mainnet**: Collateral vault (highest security, public transparency)
- **Polygon**: DAO governance (Snapshot voting, NFT credentials)

### 5. Visual Assets Requested

**Infographic 1: Data-as-Collateral Flow**
```
User contributes data
    ↓ (HEROES AI detects Helper behavior)
Unidos sells to buyers (CGIAR, carbon verifiers)
    ↓ (Revenue: $3.50/user/month)
Buy ETH → Lock in vault (150% overcollateralized)
    ↓
Mint UNIDOS tokens (1:1 USD backing)
    ↓
Distribute to users (covers transaction fees + surplus for spending)
```

**Infographic 2: Internal Barter Economy**
```
Mushroom spawn: 5 UNIDOS
Vermicompost: 10 UNIDOS
Tricycle transport: 10 UNIDOS
Training slot: 50 UNIDOS

↓ (80% internal spending, 20% cash-out)

Circular economy: Value recirculates, no extraction to banks/exchanges
```

**Chart 1: Cost Comparison**
| Method | Annual Cost | Unidos Savings |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| Traditional Banking | $75/year | $72/year (96% cheaper) |
| Mobile Money | $12.50/year | $9.30/year (74% cheaper) |
