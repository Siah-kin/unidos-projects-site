# Strategic DeFi Partnerships: Who Fits Unidos' Bottom-Up Model

**Date**: February 2026
**Status**: INTERNAL - Partnership Pipeline
**Purpose**: Identify DeFi partners dedicated to refugee-led, bottom-up scaling with low-cost infrastructure
**Context**: Unidos has 4 years of development data (2022-2026), 501 trained farmers, 6 awards, $50K+ B2B revenue, and a DAO transformation roadmap. Who builds with us?

---

## The Question

Unidos needs a strategic partner that:
1. **Builds DeFi solutions** (not just funds them)
2. **Supports scaling low-cost infrastructure** (USSD, feature phones, <$0.01/tx)
3. **Is dedicated to bottom-up development** (refugee-led, not top-down aid)
4. **Fits our consistent 4-year trajectory** (physical → B2B → DAO → data-as-collateral)

## Proven Stack: What Already Works for Refugees

A deployed technology stack for refugee blockchain payments already exists in East Africa:

```
Celo (chain) + ImpactMarket (UBI smart contracts) + Kotani Pay (USSD bridge) + Africa's Talking (telecom API)
```

This was validated by **RIO (Refugee Integration Organisation)** in Kakuma refugee camp, Kenya — $71K+ distributed to 2,500+ refugees via feature phone USSD. The architecture matches what we designed in LEAN_MOBILE_ARCHITECTURE.md.

**What makes Unidos different from RIO**: RIO distributes donated UBI (top-down). Unidos builds a productive economy where farmers earn through data contribution and B2B sales (bottom-up). That distinction matters — we don't need charity rails, we need cooperative economy infrastructure.

## Top 5 Direct-Fit Partners (Ranked)

### 1. Grassroots Economics (Sarafu Network) — FIT: 9.5/10

**Who**: Kenya-based non-profit building Community Inclusion Currencies (CICs) on Celo. Founded by Will Ruddick. 3,000+ active users, 33 commitment pools, 239 unique community vouchers.

**Why they're the #1 fit**:
- Already built **Refugee Inclusive Community Currencies (RICCs)** in partnership with Red Cross — not hypothetical, deployed
- Run on **Celo** (our primary chain), chose it for the same reasons: low fees, feature phone accessibility
- Their "Commitment Pooling" protocol is philosophically identical to the UNIDOS barter token — communities pool commitments to create exchange
- Based in **East Africa** with direct refugee camp experience
- 4-year DANIDA-funded research project at Lund University validates the model
- Open source, cooperative ethos, bottom-up

**What they bring**:
- Commitment Pooling Protocol could BE the UNIDOS barter token backbone (no need to build from scratch)
- USSD-based community currency infrastructure already deployed
- Research validation + academic credibility
- Community currency design expertise

**What we bring**:
- 501 farmers with 4 years of production data (their largest community of practice)
- Data-as-collateral innovation (novel for their model)
- HEROES behavioral KYC (extends their identity approach)
- Regenerative agriculture context (biochar, vermicompost, mushroom)

**Action**: Contact Will Ruddick. Propose Unidos as a Nakivale pilot site for Commitment Pooling, with UNIDOS barter tokens as the community voucher.

**Why they're a direct fit**:
- Unidos already trains farmers in **biochar, vermicompost, and permaculture** — the exact practices Shamba verifies
- Their satellite-based MRV can turn our biochar production into **verified carbon credits** (revenue pathway)
- Designed to be **affordable for small farmer cooperatives** (not $50K traditional MRV audits)
- Based in **Nairobi** with explicit African smallholder focus (<2 hectare farms)
- Credits list on Regen Registry (recognized marketplace)

**What they bring**:
- dMRV infrastructure: satellite + oracle = verified carbon claims
- Carbon credit marketplace access (Regen Network)
- Chainlink oracle integration (brings data on-chain)
- Multi-chain (Arbitrum, Polygon, Ethereum, Optimism)

**What we bring**:
- 501 biochar-producing farmers (significant scale for dMRV pilot)
- 100+ tons CO2 sequestered/year (monetizable)
- PQI scoring data (complements satellite verification with ground-truth)
- BRIDGE agent to coordinate data flow

**Action**: Contact Kennedy Ng'ang'a (founder). Propose dMRV pilot for 501 biochar farmers. Revenue model: verified carbon credits at $5-15/ton.

## The Winning Combination

The most powerful partnership stack for Unidos:

```
Grassroots Economics (barter token protocol on Celo)
    + Shamba Network (carbon credit dMRV for biochar)
    + Kotani Pay (USSD infrastructure for feature phones)
    = Complete technical stack for bottom-up refugee DeFi
```

All three are:
- East Africa-based
- Celo ecosystem (or compatible)
- Bottom-up development philosophy
- Already working with refugees or smallholders
- Open to cooperating with small organizations

**Mercy Corps Ventures** funds the integration. **Hypha DAO** provides the governance layer.

## What Makes Unidos Unfundable by the Wrong Partners (And That's Good)

Some organizations will never fund Unidos because our model works differently:

| Wrong Partner Type | Why They Won't Fund Us | Why That's OK |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| Top-down aid orgs | "Refugees should receive, not govern" | We build autonomous economies, not dependency |
| Token speculators | "Where's the moon potential?" | UNIDOS is a stable barter token, not a speculative asset |
| Big-NGO subcontractors | "We need implementers, not innovators" | We're not a subcontractor, we're a model |
| KYC-first fintechs | "You need government ID to access finance" | Behavioral KYC replaces document KYC — that's the point |

The right partners understand: **refugees building their own financial system is more durable than any aid delivery mechanism**.

---

## Unidos' 4-Year Advantage

No organization in our partnership pipeline has what we have:

```
2022: Physical infrastructure built (mushroom lab, compost stations, training center)
2023: 501 farmers trained, 5 programs operational, first awards
2024: Gene Dewey Award, UNHCR Innovation Fund, $50K B2B revenue, Earthshot nomination
2025: Full strategic framework (business model, DAO roadmap, wizard system, vetting funnel)
2026: Smart contracts drafted, multi-chain architecture designed, BRIDGE agent deployed

4 years of continuous development data → no cold start
501 farmers with PQI history → real behavioral dataset
$50K B2B revenue → proven market demand
6 international awards → validated credibility
```

This trajectory is what makes us fundable: we're not a pitch deck, we're 4 years of compounding execution.
