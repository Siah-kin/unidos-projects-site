## 📊 Research Documents

### 1. **UNIDOS_DAO_TRANSFORMATION_ROADMAP.md**

**Status**: 🔒 PRIVATE (not for public distribution until Phase 1 complete)

**Contents**:
- How Unidos transitions from grant-dependent NGO → self-sustaining DAO
- Analysis of 4 major NGO token projects (ImpactMarket, Alice, GiveDirectly, WFP Building Blocks)
- Critical gaps SIAH fills (trust-weighted voting, behavioral verification, anti-gaming)
- 12-month transformation roadmap (4 phases)
- Crowdfunding campaign playbook
- Technical architecture (Telegram bot + Polygon/Celo + Snapshot + Euler pool)
- Risk mitigation (wallet adoption, Sybil attacks, governance attacks, regulatory)
- Financial projections ($193K Year 1 → $1.2M Year 3)
- Success metrics (Unidos DAO vs Traditional NGO)

**Key Finding**: Unidos would be **first refugee-led DAO** with trust-weighted governance, automated behavioral impact verification, and self-sustaining economics.

### 2. **REFUGEE_NGO_BUSINESS_MODELS_COMPARISON.md**

**Status**: ✅ PUBLIC (full research)

**Organizations Analyzed**:
1. **African Women Rising** (Palabek, Uganda) — 26,600 households, permagardens, 80% yield doubling
2. **Rwamwanja Rural Foundation** (12 settlements, Uganda) — Lush Prize winner, mushroom focus, regenerative ag
3. **Social Innovation Academy (SINA)** (Nakivale + 5 countries) — 36 social enterprises, 3x alumni earnings, self-sustaining
4. **MADE51** (UNHCR, 23 countries) — 3,700 artisans, global fair trade, $752B market
5. **Village Enterprise** (Uganda/Kenya) — 534% ROI, 933% savings increase over 5 years

**Key Findings**:
- **Closest comparable**: Rwamwanja Rural Foundation (refugee-led, mushroom focus, self-sustainability goal)
- **Highest business orientation**: MADE51 (global sales) and SINA (fee-for-service)
- **Regenerative leaders**: AWR and RRF (explicit permaculture/soil focus)
- **Compounding proof**: Village Enterprise (933% savings), AWR (80% yield doubling)
- **Unidos unique advantage**: Only organization with 4 compounding loops (ecological + financial + social + data)

**Scalability Projection**:
- Conservative (Year 5): 10 settlements, 5,000 farmers, $2M revenue, 80% self-sustaining
- Aggressive (Year 10): 100 settlements, 50,000 farmers, $50M revenue, 95% self-sustaining

### 3. **HYPERSKIDS_ANALYSIS.md**

**Status**: ✅ PUBLIC (new research, February 2026)

**Subject**: Charity memecoin supporting 30+ children in Kampala, Uganda via Meteora Stake2Earn (Solana)

**Key Metrics**:
- Token price: $0.00979 (volatile: -31% in 24h, +65% in 7 days)
- To earn $8.80/day: stake $210,384 worth of HYPERSKIDS
- Comparison: BONZI earns $9.56/day with only $4,216 staked (20x more efficient)

**Revenue Model**:
- Meteora Stake2Earn: Trading fees → top stakers (5-1000 configurable)
- Compounding: Memecoin portion of rewards auto-restaked
- Cooldown: Minimum 6 hours before unstaking

**What Works** (lessons for Unidos):
- ✅ Community resilience (survived dev departure)
- ✅ Revenue sharing (trading fees → stakers, no grants needed)
- ✅ Real-time rewards (instant feedback)
- ✅ Compounding built in (auto-reinvestment)

**What Doesn't Work**:
- ❌ Extreme volatility (impossible to budget)
- ❌ No impact verification (trust-based, no proof)
- ❌ Extractive tokenomics (speculation, not value creation)
- ❌ High capital barrier ($210K for meaningful earnings)
- ❌ Market dependency (hype cycles = boom/bust)

**Strategic Recommendation**:
- **Phase 1 (Year 1-2)**: NO TOKEN — focus on B2B revenue (mushroom spawn, vermicompost, biochar)
- **Phase 2 (Year 3-4)**: EVALUATE TOKEN — if B2B revenue stable ($500K+), DAO governance proven (60%+ participation), regulatory clarity exists
- **Token design (if launched)**: Backed by B2B revenue (not pure speculation), Stake2Earn on Meteora, governance utility, low barrier (earn via cooperation score)

**Hyperskids Lesson**: Don't build on crypto alone (too volatile). Use crypto as amplifier (stable base + crypto enhancement).

## 🎯 Strategic Insights

### Compounding Models Ranked

| Rank | Organization | Compounding Type | Multiplier |
|------|--------------|------------------|------------|
| **1** | **Unidos (proposed)** | Quadruple loop (ecological + financial + social + data) | **16x per cycle** |
| **2** | Village Enterprise | Double loop (financial + social) | 4x per cycle |
| **3** | Rwamwanja Rural Foundation | Double loop (ecological + financial, local only) | 4x per cycle |
| **4** | African Women Rising | Single loop (ecological only) | 2x per cycle |
| **5** | SINA | Single loop (social only) | 2x per cycle |
| **6** | MADE51 | Single loop (financial only) | 2x per cycle |
| **7** | Hyperskids | Speculative (token price, not real value) | Volatile |

**Compounding Formula Explained**:
```
Single loop: 2x growth per cycle (e.g., soil improves → yields double)
Double loop: 4x growth per cycle (2 loops × 2x each)
Quadruple loop: 16x growth per cycle (4 loops × 2x each)
```

**Unidos Quadruple Loop**:
1. **Ecological**: Vermicompost/biochar → soil improves → yields increase → more organic waste → loop
2. **Financial**: B2B sales → revenue → equipment investment → 10x production → market dominance → loop
3. **Social**: Euler pool → cooperation scores → DAO governance → ownership → better decisions → loop
4. **Data**: PQI scoring → competitive moat → premium pricing → market access → more data → loop

## 🔍 Gap Analysis — What SIAH Fills

| Gap in Existing Projects | Why It Matters | How SIAH Solves It |
|--------------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Token-weighted voting = plutocracy** | Top 10% control 76% of voting power | **Trust-weighted voting**: Cooperation score = vote weight (helpers earn governance power, not buy it) |
| **Manual impact verification** | Expensive ($10K site visits), slow (annual audits), doesn't scale | **HEROES behavioral detection**: Automatic, real-time, AI + human hybrid |
| **No anti-gaming protection** | Sybil attacks, fake participation | **4-layer anti-gaming**: EigenTrust + Passport gate + behavioral patterns + graduated sanctions |
| **Voter apathy (17-25% turnout)** | Only whales vote, small holders don't feel impact | **Contribution-driven engagement**: HEROES community already active daily (60%+ projected turnout) |
| **No self-sustaining economy** | All depend on external funding (grants, donations) | **Euler pool self-funding**: B2B revenue → distributed by cooperation score → economy funds itself |
| **Centralized milestone verification** | Alice uses government, WFP uses UN staff (single point of failure) | **Sealed measurement + Merkle proofs**: Cryptographically verifiable, no central authority needed |
| **Top-down recipient selection** | Donors choose who gets aid, recipients have no voice | **Producers are governors**: Farmers with high PQI scores earn governance weight |
| **Wallet barriers for refugees** | 60%+ lack smartphones | **Telegram bot first**: Earn cooperation score without wallet, add wallet later (progressive onboarding) |

## 📈 Market Access & Fair Chain Optimization

### Current Problem

- **WFTO fair trade certification**: $2,000/year + audit fees (expensive, slow, annual)
- **Western NGOs get grants easily** (donor familiarity), refugee NGOs struggle (perception bias)

### SIAH Solution

**PQI Scoring = Fair Chain Without Certification**:
- $0 cost (vs $2,000 WFTO)
- Real-time (vs annual audit)
- Blockchain-verifiable (Merkle proofs)
- 100-point granular scale (vs binary "certified/not")
- Result: **30-50% premium pricing** (same as fair trade, but faster/cheaper)

**Vetted Grant Funnel**:
- Wizard auto-generates grant applications with cryptographic proof
- Donors verify impact instantly (no $10K site visit)
- Result: **40-60% approval rate** (vs 10-20% for non-verified NGOs)

**Equalizer Effect**:
```
Traditional Model:
Western NGO (familiar) → Grant approved
Refugee NGO (unknown) → Grant denied

SIAH Model:
Western NGO (self-reported) vs Refugee NGO (blockchain-verified)
→ Refugee NGO approved (higher trust via cryptographic proof)
```

## 🎓 Key Lessons from Research

### 1. Regenerative Agriculture Compounds (Proven)
- **AWR**: 80% of farmers doubled yields through soil regeneration
- **Mechanism**: Healthy soil → higher yields → more organic waste → more compost → healthier soil → loop

### 2. Social Enterprise Self-Funds (Proven)
- **SINA**: Financially self-sustainable via fee-for-service, alumni earn 3x peer average
- **Village Enterprise**: 534% ROI, beneficiaries recover full program costs in 3-4 years

### 3. Market Access Enables Scale (Proven)
- **MADE51**: 3,700 artisans, 23 countries, global fair trade sales ($752B market)
- **Mechanism**: Local social enterprise partners → export logistics → premium pricing

### 4. Refugees Can Lead (Proven)
- **RRF**: Refugee-founded, won Lush Prize, expanding to 12 settlements
- **SINA**: Founded by refugees in Nakivale, replicated to 12 locations in 5 countries

### 5. Crypto Can Fund Charity (Proven, But Volatile)
- **Hyperskids**: 30+ children supported via trading fees (Stake2Earn)
- **Problem**: -31% in 24 hours (impossible to budget)
- **Lesson**: Use crypto as amplifier, not foundation

### 6. Compounding Accelerates When Loops Connect (Hypothesis to Test)
- **Single loop** (AWR, SINA, MADE51): 2x growth per cycle
- **Double loop** (RRF, Village Enterprise): 4x growth per cycle
- **Quadruple loop** (Unidos proposed): 16x growth per cycle
- **Mechanism**: Ecological gains → financial returns → social capital → data moat → all feed back into ecological gains
